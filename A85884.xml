            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THis Treatiſe (it muſt be confeſſed) <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>1</label> hath undertaken, as a high, and weighty, ſo a tender, and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented Subject. Inſomuch that at the firſt bluſh peradventure the ſubject may be lookt upon as a burdenſome ſtone, and the diſcourſe upon it as pregnant with an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique deſign.</p>
            <p>To anticipate ſuch unmerited ſurmiſes, let me at this threſhold advertiſe the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that this Treatiſe handleth its ſubject, held forth in the Title, and not the perſons of any, nor the intereſts of any. And its ſubject is a general truth, or a Scripture-Maxime of perpetual, and commune autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, concernment, and uſe.</p>
            <p>It is true, every ſuch general verity hath its deſcent to particulars; and hath its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, both of obligation, and eviction. But, <hi>let every man take heed how he buildeth
<pb facs="tcp:114672:4"/> thereupon;</hi> that is, what conſequences he draweth thence, what particulars he redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth thereto. Such inferences, and ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences are made by the diſcourſe of man; and are variable according to the ability, or diſpoſition men have to reaſon. And they all come to this reckoning. They are either native, genuine, and virtually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed in the general axiome; or they are aliene, and but impoſed. What is genuine to ſuch an abſtract Truth, or Doctrine it ſelf will own, as it will alſo the aſſertors of it, neither needs the weakeſt, or loweſt avower of it diſtruſt its patronage. But neither it, nor the hand that holds forth it, and no more ſtands chargeable with either deductions from, or reductions to it, which are of others collection, or effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>Such a Scripture canon as this, is like the Sun which ſcatters its light, and beams every way, and upon all: and all its rayes are ever moſt ſound and pure: not one ſtricture of its influx (whatever Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers tell us) h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th the leaſt corrupt, or malignant tincture. If any fetide vapor be either diſcovered, or raiſed thereby, we muſt not blame the ſun for ſhining; the riſe thereof is from the earth, and the aſcent is by its repercuſſion of the ſun-beam, and not from the ſun, by any direct emiſſion. And if the ſun-rayes conduce by reflexion either to the detection, or drawing up of
<pb facs="tcp:114672:4"/> any ſuch matter, the earth may fault it ſelf for the breed of ſuch an exhalation, but thank the ſun both for the ſaid diſcovery, and extraction.</p>
            <p>That the whole diſcuſſion of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing book is preciſely bounded within the premiſed compaſſe, and taketh in no more then generall truth, either compriſed within the text, or relating to it, I leave the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſal of it to manifeſt. And for the intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Author, he profeſſeth ſolemnly, as in the divine preſence, and with recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of his giving an account hereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſame, that (exception of indelibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and unallowed motions of ſelf-ſeeking, partiality, and ſuch other incident to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature (as now depraved) being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted) the ſole ſpeciall, and immediate aime by him conſented unto, propoſed and fixed, to be the clearing up of the important doctrine of that Text, and in it the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of conſcience: and for more remote, and general ends, thoſe to be no other but ſuch reſultancies of this labour as all ſorts of lookers into this book will confeſs to wiſh and approve.</p>
            <p>If it come forth after notable revolutions of State have newly been, or while ſome Trepidations, or grudgings of diſtemper, growing upon ſuch occaſion, do remain; the Author could not think the publicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for that leſſe ſeaſonable, or uſeful And further conſidereth that the holy Apoſtle
<pb facs="tcp:114672:5"/> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> lived in a time of as great Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth differences and changes, nevertheleſs he had the confidence, and his prudence di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected him to write, and publiſh the politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call aſſertions, and precepts, among which the Text lyeth, and is one; and this his writing not only paſſed (for any thing I preſume appears from antiquity) without ill conſtruction of either Superiors or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, but doubtleſſe was very ſutable, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, and advantageous to the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, for both their reſolution and vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the matter it concerns. The like (in its meaſure) me thinks ſhould a diſcourſe now be, that medleth no further then with an enquiry into the ſenſe of his Text, and dealeth but with the termes of it, and with the expoſitions, doubts, and arguments that have been upon it; without the leaſt application to, or bringing into queſtion, the title unto the warrant of this Scripture, of any in place of power, or any other perſon now extant in the world. This man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of proceſſe the Author promiſeth in this Treatiſe: and doth thereupon expect in ſome proportion (though with abatement, for the worſeneſſe of this age in compariſon of the Apoſtles, and for the far greater diſparity of the perſons writing) the like ſucceſſe.</p>
            <p>It is certain that when the Apoſtle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed this Epiſtle, there had been lately, and about the ſame time were divers conteſts about ſoveraignty, and tranſverſions of
<pb facs="tcp:114672:5"/> Government within the <hi>Roman</hi> Dominion; ſome about the whole, others about ſome parts, or provinces of it: and concerning them there were oppoſite ſidings, and diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions among the people.</p>
            <p>There were about, and preſently upon the writing of this Scripture ſeveral competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the Empire. <hi>Galba</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi> is raiſed up by <hi>Julius Vindex</hi> againſt <hi>Nero;</hi> and he being confirmed by the Senate, and <hi>Nero</hi> ſuppreſſed, preſently <hi>Vitellius</hi> is ſet up againſt <hi>Galba.</hi> And after <hi>Galbas</hi> violent death <hi>Otho</hi> is made Emperour at <hi>Rome,</hi> whileſt <hi>Vitellius</hi> ſtands up in <hi>Germany. Otho</hi> being quickly gone, <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> is promoted in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Judea;</hi> and the competition betwixt <hi>Vitellius</hi> and him is proſecuted by the ſword in <hi>Italie,</hi> and even in the City of <hi>Rome</hi> (whither this Epiſtle was ſent) and that with diverſity of ſucceſſe viciſſitudinarily to both parties. As to particular Provinces; <hi>Vologeſes</hi> the <hi>Parthian</hi> takes <hi>Armenia</hi> from the <hi>Romans;</hi> thence grew wars betwixt the invader, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded. In <hi>Judea</hi> the <hi>Jewes</hi> generally rebel againſt the <hi>Roman,</hi> and ſet up an <hi>Autonomie.</hi> In <hi>England</hi> the <hi>Britains</hi> ſeiſe on the <hi>Roman</hi> Colony at <hi>Camalodunum</hi> (or <hi>Maldon</hi> in <hi>Eſſex</hi>) cut off the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers, and poſſeſſe themſelves of it. It may be deemed there were Chriſtians in all theſe controverted places, and under each of the reſpective conteſtants. It is certain by Scripture there were in <hi>Jewry.</hi> And to let paſſe what

            <p>The Chriſtians that then were at <hi>Rome,</hi> and in thoſe other places were concerned ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as Souldiers, or Subjects in theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions, and counterſeiſures: and as there is no queſtion but they made this concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a matter of conſcience, ſo there is little doubt but they, or ſome of them, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the beginnings of thoſe ſeverall conteſts, and mutations were ſcrupled in conſcience which way to take. Our query concerning them is not which of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litigants reſpectively they were to own and obey as their Soveraign Magiſtrate (for I ſhall not take in hand the intereſt of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſons, to debate the juſtneſſe of any of their cauſes, or titles) but, what ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard, rule, or light of Gods word they had to go by, and by which to determine what to do under the ſcruple and temptation of contrary demanders of their ſubjection and aſſiſtance. If anything were delivered to them by this Apoſtle, or any other of their inſtructions that is not in holy writ we have no record or notice of that: but within the compaſſe of thoſe Scriptures which were directed to any ſuch Chriſtians in thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:114672:6"/> times there is none (I think it will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged) ſo likely to be written for that uſe, or to afford ground, and matter for their guidance therein as this; wherein the Magiſtrates authority is not only aſſerted, but derived, and defined; and as to them, ſo it may be to others in any the like caſe.</p>
            <p>Having given this account of the ſubject, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label> and of the manner of handling it in this Treatiſe; I ſhall now touch upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements leading to it. In the doing of this, though I ſhall reflect ſomething upon the late paſſed occurrents, yet it ſhall only be on ſuch as are free, and of common appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, not any thing perſonall, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to any one party ſingled out from the reſt.</p>
            <p>The great ſubject of debate, difference, exagitation, and contrivement in the late Commotions, that which the moſt ſtir hath been about is the matter of Authority. Divers other things, indeed, have (ſcarce any thing but hath) been in diſpute with ſome, or other. No principle ſo plain, no right ſo manifeſt, but ſome have been to ſtand up in queſtion or contradiction of it. But in all the controverſies that have riſen, there is nothing (to my obſervation) that hath been ſo univerſally, really, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuedly inſiſted on as this matter of Power. This hath been ſingled out as the <hi>Helena</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:114672:7"/> of contention, the bone of ſtrife, the hall of litigious agitation, and that which men may be noted to have moſt generally, cordially, and conſtantly proſecuted. The Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, and unquiet ſpirits in the modern Perturbations, when they have had their ſhort velitations, their ſlight skirmiſhes in other points, they have ordinarily ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, centred, and joyned iſſue in this ſubject.</p>
            <p>This may be obſerved by a tranſient view of the debates in their ſeverall kinds. They have been various both for the manner of managing, and for the matter concerned. For the manner of managing, ſome have been military, ſome mentall; ſome in the field, others in the cloſet; ſome acted by the hand, others by the head; ſome by the ſword, others by the pen. But in all theſe wayes, whatſoever hath been firſt ſtarted, or begun with, the ſtaires of Superiority, and Dignity have been the thronged and beaten rode, the garland of honour, the common and ſtanding mark which the aimes, and altercations of men have at length fixed upon.</p>
            <p>And for the matter concerned, ſome of the differences have been of a Religious, others of a Civill importance. Thoſe in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion have been either betwixt the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts, and the Proteſtants, or of theſe latter among themſelves.</p>
            <p>For Popiſh controverſies, the diſtinct
<pb facs="tcp:114672:7"/> diſcuſſion of the many points of Faith, and Religion (each whereof had formerly its particular, and exact traverſe) is now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in a manner to this as the only or main head, the power of the Pope, to wit, the prerogatives of his Crown, and Chair, or the univerſality, and ſupremacy of Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and the infallibility of judgement he claimeth over the whole world, or over all Chriſtian States and conſciences.</p>
            <p>In the latter, thoſe of the Proteſtants among themſelves; many uncouth, and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terodox tenents, and bickerings about the ſame, there have been raiſed, eſpecially in theſe Iſlands: but the thing which (I think) hath abidden moſt contention (the moſt both for the multitude, and vehemency of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders) and which hath been ſtill held up, and diſceptations have been continuedly (under ſome, or other notion) renewed about it, is the matter of Church Order, and Eccleſiaſticall Power. One while the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion hath referred to the Forme of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; another while it hath been about the Cenſures in the Church, their warrant, kindes, or extent; another while about the Maintenance, another while about the Office and calling of the Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>And for matters Civill, though the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions therein were begun upon ſeverall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, as about Laws, about Property, about Liberty, and about Magiſtratical Prerogative, and Power; yet at length this laſt hath
<pb facs="tcp:114672:8"/> taken the place of all the reſt, and ſet it ſelf up alone. And in the upſhot, what have the croſſe deviſings, and debates of mens heads, and tongues fixed upon? and about what have their conflicting, and counterworking hands all claſped, but this rocky Pyramis of worldly power?</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>3</label> As it cannot be denyed that the conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about this above all others have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the moſt generall, violent, multiplying, and laſting; ſo perhaps it will not be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impertinent to conſult a little what may be the cauſe, or how it comes to paſſe ſo to be. Something, as the reaſon or riſe of this may be obſerved, in the nature of the thing it ſelf; ſomething in man; and ſomething in what may be probably apprehended to be the fate, or predicted lot of the preſent times.</p>
            <p>In the nature of the thing it ſelf, we may take notice, not only that it is a matter of humane temporall intereſt (about which through the earthlineſſe of men, and every ones partiality of judgement, and immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of affection to himſelf, men are moſt ſubject to precipitancy of paſſion, and daz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of reaſon, and conſequently to mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all diſcord) but that it is that humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt which of all others is moſt contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertible.</p>
            <p>It is eaſie to ſee that the precepts, and relative duties comprehended in the fifth
<pb facs="tcp:114672:8"/> Commandement are more then any other of that table ſubject to diverſity and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of judgement, practiſe and claime. When our Saviour would give an inſtance of the Phariſees wide, and palpable variation from, and eluſion of the ſound ſenſe of the Commandements of God, he made choice to do it in this of <hi>Honour tby Father and thy Mother.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 15.3.</note>
            </p>
            <p>To note the Seminary and ſpring of this matter a little more particularly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Every humane intereſt is ſo much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to Controverſie as it is of worth, or concernment real or reputed. Now the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and rights of this commandement have in this reſpect the preeminency. Thence we may take it to be that they have the priority of place in the order of the precepts of the ſecond Table; and deſervedly, for the other Commandements of that Table give order about the adjuncts of man, but this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth of his perſon to a certain ſtate, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and perſonal obligation. The other Commandements reſpect each ſome one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt; this hath a ſupereminent influence upon all, to wit, for their ſecurement to the proprietors, and the mutual communication of them to others behoof, by the ſuperinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of a ſuperior reſpectively. The other Commandements provide for the intereſt of men as ſingle, or ſeverall perſons, this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecteth for them by and in ſociety.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb facs="tcp:114672:9"/>2. Another occaſion of controverſie is the peculiarity, or appropriation of a thing. What every man is in ſome proportion a partaker, or capable of (ſuch are the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the other Commandements) is not ſo expoſed to emulation, and ſimulty, as what is confined to one, or a few, as is the ſtate of Superiority in this Commandement. That which in this kinde can be owing, and payable only to one is uſually deſired, and many times claimed by many. It is obſerved that there were thirty competitors once on foot for one, and the ſame throne, to wit, that of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, who confounded one another<note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Matth. Prideaux</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod <hi>4.</hi> Sect. <hi>33.</hi> pag. <hi>205.</hi> It was anno Chriſti <hi>260.</hi> in the time of <hi>Galienus</hi> the Emperour.</note>. And I think our age hath ſeen a greater number of aſpirers for a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower Territory. Now this comes to create both interruption to him that ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and diſtraction to him that ought to pay duty: when the latter is to ſtrive, not only with his own loathneſſe to part with any honour, gain, or labour from himſelf to another, but with the doubts and dangers ariſing from contrariety of demandants. In ſuch a caſe, to avoid wrong to another, and peril, and ſcruple to himſelf, to diſcern whoſe the right is, and duly to render it, how difficult a thing doth even he finde it whoſe minde is moſt honeſtly, and imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally diſpoſed: and if this cauſe ſuch demurs, and diſtractions in an upright breaſt, how much more will it in partiall and ſelf-intere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted ſpirits, who are far the greater number?</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb facs="tcp:114672:9"/>3. It addeth to the controverſarineſſe of the ſubject of this Commandement, that the thing injoyned to be yeelded alwayes, or for moſt part is, that which is out of the hands of the proprietor, and in the hand of him that is to render it to him. Honour, we ſay, is in the honourer, and not in him that is to be honoured. Other Commandements do aſſert that to a man, that is, or may be alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in his occupation, but this attributes that which one man ſtill hath to receive, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to part with. And beſides, much of the return conſiſts not in the transferring, but in the immanent act of him that yeelds it; in which kinde of matter there is prone to be on the one part (his that is to receive ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, or reſpect) forwardneſs, freeneſs, largeneſſe of expectation, and claim: on the other (his that is to expend, or part with duty) ſlowneſs, delay, and retentive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. In the former there is apt to be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villing, and jealouſie: in the latter a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſneſs to queſtioning, and grudging; on both ſides an inclination to arbitrarineſs in favour of it ſelf: all which are the next matter, and ſeed of diviſion, and ſtrife. So much of riſe we find for this had Symptom in the thing it ſelf.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But a greater, and ſtronger reaſon, or <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>4</label> root of this is in mans nature, <hi>viz</hi> a keen, and earneſt appetite of Rule, which of all other deſires in man is moſt common, and
<pb facs="tcp:114672:10"/> predominant. The incendiaries, and foment of all contentions among men (the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture teacheth us) are their luſts. Every man hath an armed, and fighting multitude of theſe in him (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) But the leader of all theſe luſts;<note place="margin">James 4.1.</note> the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, chief, and maſter of them is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of command, chieftainſhip, and maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Ambition with greateſt probability is conceived to have been the firſt ſin, as well of degenerating man, as of the falling An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. This is the Captain, and ſo the moſt active and domineering of all other luſts; not only by virtue of its firſt entry (as <hi>Joab</hi> obtained the Generalſhip by being firſt in ſcaling the fort of the <hi>Jebuſites;</hi>) but from hence, that man being a rationall creature, he would have himſelf, and others gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by reaſon; and being in that faculty corrupt, &amp; prejudicate, he eſteems his own judgment, whatever it be, to be the only right, and ſound reaſon; and therefore moſt worthy to take place, and give order to all others. And moreover, this affection hath no little nouriſhment in him from the ſenſe of the conſequents, or attendants on Superiority, which are honour, and glory, things which men are generally exceſſively in love with; and beſides, not only theſe, but all other things come within the beck, and verge of Government. Dominion (as was ſaid) according to its proportion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing comprehenſive of all the acquiſitions,
<pb facs="tcp:114672:10"/> and poſſeſſibles of man; and ſtanding ſeiſed of the command thereof is furniſhed to be the purveyor, and accommodator of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther luſts: the which it uſually becomes when it is ſought, and attained from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate principle, and hath ſtrength to its will.</p>

            <p>As the Holy Ghoſt predicteth this event in the cauſes, ſo doth he it in the effect it ſelf. This, as I underſtand, he doth in the Propheſie of the <hi>ſeven vials,</hi>

Among other reaſons againſt the former, which is the more common Expoſition, this is one, that it placeth the <hi>Beaſt</hi> upon that City, as his ſeat, whereas the beſt Expoſitor, the Text it ſelf contrarywiſe ſeats the <hi>great whore,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 17.1, 3, 7, 9, 18.</note> 
               <hi>the woman</hi> which it interpreteth to emblemize <hi>that great City which reigneth over the Kings of the earth</hi> (and which the conſent of Expoſitors both ancient and modern, and of theſe, both Proteſtant, and Popiſh interpret to be the City of <hi>Rome</hi>) upon <hi>the Beaſt,</hi> and makes the <hi>Beaſt</hi> to carry her, and the <hi>Beaſts ſeven beads</hi> to be <hi>ſeven mountains on which the woman,</hi> that great City <hi>ſitteth,</hi> and his <hi>ten hornes</hi> to be thoſe <hi>Kings over which ſhe reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth.</hi> And further, for our rejection of both the aforeſaid Expoſitions, the Text it ſelf gives us very plainly, and appoſitely ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther application of <hi>the ſeat of the beaſt.</hi> For what is the Seat or Throne of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> but that upon, or over which he is ſet, or placed? But the Angel that firſt ſheweth, and then explaineth the Viſion, and myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the <hi>woman,</hi> and of the <hi>Beaſt that carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her,</hi> and of his ſeven heads, and ten horns, ſaith expreſly unto <hi>John, the waters which thou
<pb facs="tcp:114672:12"/> ſawest, where the whore ſitteth</hi> (and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon which the beaſt that carryeth her is placed, the <hi>ubi</hi> where ſhe ſitteth being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the ſeat of him that carryeth her.) <hi>are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues,</hi> verſ. 15. Nay, which makes this yet clearer, in the viſionary deſcription of the great whore, which precedeth this expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Angel, ſhe is ſaid <hi>to ſit upon many waters,</hi> verſ. 1. ſo that theſe many wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters (ſo applyed as hath been ſhewed in verſ. 15.) are not only the <hi>ubi</hi> where, but expreſly the ſeat upon which this woman (this City) ſitteth.</p>
            <p>It is further to be obſerved, that in this Viſion three ſeats are attributed to her;
<list>
                  <item>1. She ſits upon many waters, <hi>verſ.</hi> 1.</item>
                  <item>2. She ſits upon the Beaſt, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3.</item>
                  <item>3. She ſits upon ſeven mountains, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by the ſeven heads of that Beaſt, <hi>verſ</hi> 9.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>It may without either ſhew of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, or much difficulty be conceived how all this diverſity may be accorded. If we take the Angels Expoſition of the woman to be the great City, and that City to be <hi>Rome,</hi> we may thus apply it to thoſe three ſeats. Thoſe ſeven heads, as they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port ſeven mountains, are the Natural or Topicall ſeat, or ſite of that City, the ſeat on which it ſtandeth, or is built The <hi>Beaſt,</hi> that is, the Dominion, Power, or Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb facs="tcp:114672:12"/> which that City poſſeſſeth, and which bears it up (for by the Beaſt is commonly interpreted the <hi>Roman</hi> Soveraignty, or Empire) is the immediate politicall ſeat of that City. And the many waters, explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to our hand, to intend <hi>peoples, multitudes, nations, and tongues,</hi> are the mediate politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſeat of that City, that is, they are the ſeat of the Beaſt, or they are the ſeverall Communities, or Republiques which once were all one, and belonged to, and were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Dominion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, poſſeſſed by that City. The iſſue then is, as to our purpoſe, the Woman, that great City is immediately ſeated upon the Beaſt, the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and mediately upon the waters, that is, upon thoſe <hi>peoples, and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, &amp;c.</hi> once (that is, in the Apoſtles time) under the power of that Empire: and the Beaſt is immediately ſeated upon <hi>thoſe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, thoſe people, &amp;c.</hi> Theſe then in all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood (not to ſay certainly) are to be taken to be <hi>the ſeat of the Beaſt.</hi>

The latter ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can only ſuit here, for the former (as was aforeſhewed) is meant by <hi>the Beaſt</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. The Kingdom ruling is the Beaſt, the Kingdom ruled is the ſeat of the Beaſt; this latter then is the Kingdom here meant, the ſeat of the Beaſt, the people governed: and agreably to this ſenſe ſound the words fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, theſe, <hi>and they gnawed their tongues for pain;</hi> who can be underſtood by this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative <hi>they,</hi> but a plurality, a multitude, theſe are <hi>the ſeat of the Beaſt</hi> upon which the <hi>Vial</hi> is poured out, his <hi>Kingdom</hi> which up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that is <hi>full of darkeneſſe,</hi> and thoſe, <hi>they,</hi> who upon it, <hi>gnaw their tongues for pain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some clearneſſe appearing in this point, what is underſtood by the ſeat of the Beaſt, which is the ſubject of this Viall, the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the effect which it hath upon this ſeat (for the obſerving of which, as perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to our purpoſe, I make this reflexion upon this place) will eaſily follow. The effect is, that <hi>his Kingdome is</hi> (or, the people anciently of the Beaſts Empire are) <hi>full of darkneſſe, and they gnaw their tongues for pain, and blaſpheme the God of heaven becauſe of their pains, and their ſores, and repent not of their deeds.</hi> This <hi>Kingdom-filling darkneſſe</hi> may import a deluſive obfuſcation, errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,
<pb facs="tcp:114672:13"/> giddineſſe, and dotage, which ſhall at the time, and in the place of this Vials pouring forth (and may not its time, and place be the preſent?) poſſeſſe, and prevail over the mindes and judgements of men about the matter of Power and Authority, Civill, in the firſt place, and Eccleſiaſticall conſequently, and by way of participation. And this darkneſſe muſt needs cauſe a Chaos of confuſion, commotion, and contention. The <hi>tongue-gnawing pain,</hi> and that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, blaſpheming, and impenitency, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret of worldly griefs, and dolours, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from all ſorts of ſufferings, and dangers upon bodies, eſtates, and other temporall intereſts; and of conſcience-tortures by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, ſcruples, and guilt; which the ſaid obſcurity will breed unto people; and which being incumbent on them will (eſpecially in the faeces, the worſe, the more hardned ſort of them) boile up unto extreme vexation, and anguiſh, yea unto rage, and fury, whence they will break forth into blaſphemy againſt God, by caſting (in their ſpite, and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe) the blame, and ſcandall of all their ſufferings, and diſtempers upon the Goſpell, Religion, and Reformation, and upon the faithfull, and zealous friends, and followers of the ſame; accuſing them of Rebellion, and bringing ruine upon Church, and State; and charging them as the cauſes of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Commotions, and Convulſions, and of their own private adverſities, and agonies
<pb facs="tcp:114672:14"/> flowing from them; which, indeed, are the fruits of their own error, and the recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of their own ſins; and which ſhould have wrought on them for their repentance, but prove ineffectuall to that, and occaſionall to the contrary, the continuation, and heightning of their ſin, and an addition to their judgements.</p>
            <p>Having upon the occaſion of obſerving this effect gone ſo far in looking into this Viall, I cannot well let paſſe the noting (but it ſhall be in one word) the corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondency which is betwixt this, and the next foregoing Viall, and the apt ſequency of the one upon the other. That <hi>fourth Viall</hi> I ſuppoſe to bear this ſenſe. <hi>The Sun,</hi> upon which it is powred out, is the Soveraign or Royall dignity reſiding in the ſeverall Princes, or Eſtates ſignified by thoſe ten hornes, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.12. Its effect, to wit, that upon it <hi>power is given to the Sun to ſcorch men with fire,</hi> may ſignifie the paſſions of thoſe Princes, their inordinate, and bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe appetite of rule, their emulations, and jealouſies tranſporting them above it, their immeaſurable aſpiring, ambitions and ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rices, from which they are in ſpeciall ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, and enflamed to an exorbitant ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and heightning of their power, and prerogative over their people, for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing, enlarging, and maintaining where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they proceed to thoſe precipitate coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and violent courſes, which do exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:114672:14"/> waſt, and cruſh, and in ſo doing diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, exaſperate, and enrage their ſubjects. And theſe are the heats, and flames by which men under this Viall (as by a <hi>Zenith</hi> Sun) are ſcorched.</p>
            <p>Upon that effect of the <hi>fourth Viall</hi> this of the <hi>fifth</hi> very ſutably, and even naturally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues. As the Summer-ſun-beames by their glowing heat having a good while together penetrated, and even toſted the earth, thereupon the earth comes to ſend up many groſſe fumes, and vapors to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſting, and enveloping of the aire; by which means the Sun being overcaſt, the earth it ſelf is deprived both of its ſhine and light; ſo it is betwixt Potentates and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The abuſes, and exceſſes of Princes by which they overtop, gall, and excruciate their Subjects, raiſe, and retort cloudes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves, and their own power, and dignity; their people thence conceiving, and venting many blinde, inconſiderate, and groſſe miſtakes, many heady, and mutinous conteſtations about their Soveraigns power, and prerogative; and this to the reciprocall, mighty prejudice both of Prince and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; the one coming thereby to be eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, if not diſorbed: and the other, while they by ſuch reflexions ſeek to allay, and cool the heat, darted upon them by the too great elevation, and verticall influence of their Sun, having thereby changed their day into darkneſſe, are overwhelmed with
<pb facs="tcp:114672:15"/> confuſions, night-wandrings, and horrors, and do pine away in black, penſive, and hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe obſcurity.</p>
            <p>To this that hath been ſaid of theſe Vials portending the more then ordinary inclination of the times allotted to them unto diſceptations, and claſhings about Government, I ſhall add a touch upon another Propheſie looking ſomewhat the ſame way, the rather becauſe much looked upon now by ſome men. It is part of the matter of the third woe, and ſeventh Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet,<note place="margin">Rev. 11.15.</note> in thoſe words, <hi>There were great voices in heaven, ſaying, the Kingdomes of the world are become the Kingdoms of the Lord, and of his Chriſt.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.24.</note> To which may be joyned that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Then cometh the end, when he ſhall have put down all rule, and all autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and power.</hi> There is much recourſe had to theſe, and the like prenunciations, now-a-dayes, and ſtrange uſe made of them. I am none of thoſe that have the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to define, either the time when, or the means, or manner how theſe paſſages ſhall be accompliſhed. Much leſſe do I ſort with thoſe who upon preſumption that they ſhall receive their completion before the worlds end, or while time is yet current, and in a worldly, and temporall manner, and by humane means, and force, do thence conclude it a neceſſary, and prime duty of Chriſtians, to lend their aſſiſtance to the bringing of them to effect, by laying
<pb facs="tcp:114672:15"/> their heads, and conſerting their hands to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to plot, and act the pulling down of all Civil Powers humanely conſtituted, and ſo to the making way, and entry to that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, and of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But this may be ſaid with ſobriety, who knowes what prelude, or preparative may be in, what uſe the unſearchable wiſdome of God may make of, the many unſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and unappeaſable ſtirrings, and jarrings both of the men of this, and of divers other ſpirits, and principles about Government, to the bringing about of his own counſels predeclared in thoſe Prophetique paſſages? One thing may be affirmed without pretence of ſupernaturall light, either from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture prediction, or from private Enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſme, as that which comes within common experience, and reaſon; that debates, and competitions about authority (eſpecially when ſo multiplyed, and obſtinate) do bode, and tend to its downfall. The more diſcuſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſtirs are raiſed about it; the more climbings up to, and corrivalſhips for it, the more ſtill the Majeſty, and luſtre of Authority is defaced, the foundations, and ſtrength of it are ſhaken, the more it tottereth, and inclineth unto ruine.</p>
            <p>Moreover, as this is the natural effect of that, ſo it may be taken ſome notice of, that the previſion, and preſage of a time of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid violence, and confuſion, and of ſpoile, and expilation by the ſubverſion of all Laws, and
<pb facs="tcp:114672:16"/> humane Authority, reſtraint, and reverence, to come upon the latter ages of the world, hath ſadly poſſeſſed the mindes of many ſage, and learned Chriſtians, both ancient, and latter. To give ſome inſtance, as that of <hi>Tertullian,</hi>

            <p>For the better diſpoſing, and drawing of mens mindes to the doing of this will of God in this particular, and for the abating of the pernitious contentions aboveſaid to be now ſo incident, and rife about it, and which are the great obſtacles of mens per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the Divine will in this matter, Two things (I ſuppoſe) will be eaſily admitted to be chiefly deſirable, and contributory. One on the part of the Government it ſelf, which is, that it be evidently laid upon a ground of conſcience, a juſt foundation, or which is the ſame, that it apparently be by divine authority, or according to that rule, or will of God which we are to do. The other (which alſo is conducible unto that) is on the part of thoſe that are concerned in, or upon its being ſetled, to wit, that it be clear, and underſtood wherein conſiſteth that regularity, and how the divine au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorization held forth by it is paſſed, or conveyed unto mens inveſture in it.</p>
            <p>For the requiſiteneſs, and uſefulneſſe of theſe two a little may ſerve to be ſaid. The former is, <hi>that Government be laid upon a bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of conſcience.</hi> This is the only genuine, true, and connaturall, and this is the ſureſt, and firmeſt groundwork for it. Without this there is little hope for it to prove either beneficial, or permanent, little likelyhood of either a reall regular, or durable ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to it. The diſcernable ſtanding of Government upon conſciencious grounds,
<pb facs="tcp:114672:17"/> is the only thing that can bring in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and a conſciencious ſubmiſſion to it. Conſcience (that is, a perſwaſion of the thing to be done, that it is as it ought to be, or is right and juſt) is the higheſt, and moſt kindly principle of any humane, or morall act. It is both the ſtrongeſt, and moſt laſting obligation to any relative duty. It is the ſtrongeſt, and moſt inducing tye, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the dictate of the ſupremeſt facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in man, the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, his minde, or intellectuall part, and that upon the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulleſt perſwaſive, a Law received from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and from God. And it is the moſt laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tie.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In being upon a conſideration which is in it ſelf certain, and immutable, <hi>viz.</hi> the everlaſting rule of righteouſneſſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Inaſmuch as it doth moſt engage the will, and ſo procures the moſt volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, and free accord unto that which it impoſeth.</p>
            <p>There is ſcarce that thing which is more neceſſary to mankinde (conſidered in ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety) then Government; but nothing would be more free in its impoſall, and reception. It is true, a coercive power is (in the preſent depravation of man) requiſite to it, both for its conſervation, and effectuall admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, but this is not proper, nor can it ſerve to be its procreative, or conſtitutive, no nor ſole conſervative cauſe. It is eaſie to diſcerne that the perſonall ſtrength of one
<pb facs="tcp:114672:18"/> man or a few Chieftains of a Community is not ſufficient to this coercion: and that Magiſtracy cannot have, or validly put forth without the cordiall concurrence of a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. For a Magiſtrate to hold, and put forth this power by the ſtrong hand of a conſenting multitude diſtinct from, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to that he rules over, who ſees not the unnaturalneſſe, and unſtableneſſe of ſuch a command? This will never incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the governing, and governed, or joynt them in one politicall body, but ſhall alway keep them diſpartite, and ſet them in a ſtate of jealouſie, diſcontent, and counter-working each of other. If force be all that interveneth to the relation, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondency of ruler, and ruled, how ſhould that hold? an averſation of wils, and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions will work out it ſelf, and either diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſever, or daſh them together. <hi>Vim vi repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mere</hi> is a practiſe which begets the like to it in the other on whom it is practiſed and that is <hi>Vim vi rependere, &amp; repellere.</hi> Theſe two are principles, and ſtudies that ſit deep, and keep the ſubject they poſſeſſe reſpectively in continuall motion. He that is up, and ſtands by the former hath but little eaſe, and leſſe ſtayedneſſe; he that is down, and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates the latter is like a vapour under ground ſwelling, and ſearching to rend out its paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage into the open air, with the breach, or fall of what ever is betwixt it, and its freedom.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:114672:18"/>
            <p>The right, and durable baſis then that is left unto Magiſtracy is that which is ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with a compoſure of the wils of them over whom it is. Now the will is two wayes conciliated, or won. One is by the ſenſe of an external, or temporal accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, or advantage. The other is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noteſcency of a morall obligation, or tye of conſcience. The former is but an inferior, and low attractive, and it is beneath a rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall faculty to be taken with it by it ſelf alone, or as the commanding principle. That were as if the ſervant ſhould govern his maſter, the beaſt its rider, or the body over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power its ſoul. And for the point of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance; though the motion of it be impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, and it ſtrongly worketh upon the ſenſitive conceit, and appetite, yet it parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipates of the nature of its object, in being variable, and uncertain. To incline the will to obedience is but accidentall, and contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to the ſenſe of a temporall good, it is as prone to oppoſe, and withdraw from it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indifferent, and equally poyſed to diſpoſe the minde, either to ſubjection, or contuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as the one, or the other may ſeem to favour its object.</p>
            <p>But the latter, the evidence of a conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence obligation that's the moſt weighty, and meriting perſwaſive, that's alway the ſame, that takes an immediate, and deeper hold on the rationall faculty, yea, and is of as generall extent, and influence as the other;
<pb facs="tcp:114672:19"/> all men, and nations retaining ſome touch of religion, and conſcience, and of it as much, and as univerſally in this of Civill authority, and obedience as in any particular.</p>
            <p>And in truth, if we ſhould make a reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon our ſelves in this Nation (which is ſo naturally addicted to Lawes, and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that hath received the knowledge, and profeſſion of the true Religion, that hath been of late ſo much buſied in looking up Scripture mouldes, and dictates of this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that hath had almoſt all the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that can likely be raiſed in this behalf laid open, and agitated to, and fro, that hath had ſo often in this buſineſſe tendred ſuch conſcience-preſſing adjurations, and engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and hath ſhewed (if recitations, urgings, and diſputes about them be argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thereof) to be ſolicitous of them, and laſtly, that hath both by words, and actions both declared, and had declared to it a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiouſneſſe in this matter) it cannot (I ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y) be rationally expected that any other way of ſetling then upon clear grounds of conſcience ſhould here take.</p>
            <p>The requiſitneſſe of the firſt of the two afore propoſed expedients appearing, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of the ſecond immediately followes upon it; and is evident by the conceſſion of the other. For if it be admitted needfull that a ground, or principle of conſcience be the baſis of Government, it will be confeſſed as needfull that a rule of Gods revealed or
<pb facs="tcp:114672:19"/> preceptive will (which is the only cynoſure, guide, and empereſſe of conſcience) touching the founding, and erecting of Government be laid forth, and that, both <hi>verbo tenus, &amp; re,</hi> both the words, and the thing, that is, both which is the rule, where delivered, and alſo what it ſaith, or ordereth, or what is its genuine ſenſe, and meaning.</p>
            <p>In the want, or uncertainty of this all ſettlement upon this groundwork will be to ſeek. Though the thing ſetled be right, yet the beneficiall influence of that rectitude upon the conſcience, and will ſhall be ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeded; and in ſtead thereof it will be atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with a diſreliſh, muttering, and diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance in the ſame.

The latter, which is the inquiring out of the rule, with its interpretation, and meaning, is that I only take in hand; and this will not be denyed to lie within the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts of my calling. Might it be evident ere I have done to be as well within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of my performance, it would be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of ſatisfaction both to my Reader (poſſibly) and to my ſelf.</p>
            <p>This, I ſay, is the whole reach and limit of what followeth; and it will be by it ſelf enough. For as the making plain of this will be acknowledged to be ſingularly conducing to the allay, and pacification of much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſure, and to be preparative and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of obedience to the will of God in this behalf; ſo it cannot be denyed, but that the rule it ſelf, the inveſtigation whereof we are upon, falleth under ſome controverſie.</p>
            <p>The plaineſt, and fulleſt paſſage of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture for the holding forth of this rule, and the way how the Divine Authorization is conveyed to particular perſons, for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſting thereby with Civil authority, I take for granted to be the prefixed text, <hi>[There is no power but of God: the Powers that be are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained of God.]</hi> And therefore having for that reaſon, laid down that for the ground, and
<pb facs="tcp:114672:20"/> center of my diſcourſe, I ſhall immediately proceed to it.</p>
            <p>In the late times of diſpute about ſtate government much recourſe hath been had to this Scripture. Each different way hath ſought to it for patronage, and endevoured to make it of its party. This hath raiſed a variety of ſenſes, and interpretations, and thereby ſome obſcurity upon it. That which hath been ſaid of ſome other Scriptures may be of this. This text had been plain, had there not been ſo many Expoſitors upon it. I cannot aſcribe the controvertibleneſſe of it, ſo much to any Grammatical, or Metaphyſical difficulty of the termes, as to the value, which the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it conſiſteth of, beareth.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The ſubject of it: nothing higher in place, or more in eſteem with men then it, <hi>viz.</hi> Civill power.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The predicate: nothing more ſublime can be ſpoken of any thing (as to its origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation) then it, to wit, that it is of God, ordained of God. The deſireableneſſe of the ſubject, and the divineneſſe of the predicate ſeem in their conjunction to occaſion the diſputeableneſſe of theſe words.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of our Commotions the ſentence next before this <hi>[Let every ſoul be ſubject to the higher powers]</hi> underwent the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate: and therein the extent, or latitude of the power, and ſubjection it aſſerteth. Since that the queſtion hath paſſed on to the next,
<pb facs="tcp:114672:21"/> which are theſe words, and upon them the main queries are, who the perſons are that are here termed the Powers, which are of God, ordained of God? and (in order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto) what is meant by the Powers? what by of God and ordained of God?</p>
            <p>The exceeding (and in my opinion exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive) wide-ſtretching of this ſtyle, The power of God, ordained of God, by ſome Authors anteceding theſe times, hath to me ſeemed ſtrange, and to have given ſome riſe to the late diverſity of applications of it. Beſides the peculiar (and I am confident the only intended) application of it to the Civill Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate there are that have imagined in it much broader accommodations.</p>
            <p>That great light of the Church in his times, and ſince, St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> (the authority of whoſe example hath perhaps led others to do the like) extendeth this propoſition, There is no power but of God, to take in all power whatſoever that can be named, and is in any creature.

            <p>There is none of thoſe uſes of this text, or of the Divine warrant it hold forth to the Civill Magiſtrate, but (with reverence to thoſe authors of any of them who are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged with us to deſerve it) I look at as going beyond the juſt bounds thereof. This Treatiſe doth not propoſe the diſtinct, or particular examination of each of them. But its inquiſition into the poſitive impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of this Text will manifeſtly diſcover the diſintereſtedneſſe of every one of them therein. And the laſt, being it is commended by ſuch names; being it hath been taken hold of, and confidently inſiſted on by many of
<pb facs="tcp:114672:22"/> late, both upon the account of the deſerved eſteem of thoſe Authors, and by other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; being it hath ſome more ſhadow, or appearance then the reſt of approaching neer the meaning of this Text, and ſo ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth more in our light, or way to the clear view of it; being it hath been currently recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and patronized by divers; and being it is of the concernment which will eaſily be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to be in it; this Treatiſe (with all due reſpect to thoſe who may be entertainers of the ſaid ſenſe, and wiſh ſubmiſſion to the further ſifting of the Judicious) doth profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly deal with, and bring it under a hearing, and Tryall.</p>

                  <p>IT may be of ſome uſe for the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the meaning of this word <hi>Power,</hi> to take notice whether it be put here for the Officer, or for the Office, for the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, or for Magiſtracy. The Scripture uſeth the term both wayes. Sometimes in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract, or for the form, office, or ſtate, which makes and denominates one a Superiour to others. [So <hi>Luk.</hi> 20.20. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.2. <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.13.] Sometimes in the concrete, or for the perſon in whom that abſtract form, or office is ſubjected. [So it is <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.38. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.21. &amp; 3.10. &amp; 6.12. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.1. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.22.] That it is this latter way to betaken in this place, not only Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators agree, [for which ſee <hi>Auguſtin Tom.</hi> 4. <hi>part.</hi> 2. <hi>Expoſ. propoſ. ex Epiſt. ad Rom.

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:114672:26"/> cannot be the ſubject, or recipient either of the duties required, and argued for in this text to be payed to the Power therein mentioned, or of the offences forbidden, and threatned (if done) againſt it: neither can it be the agent, or adminiſtrant of thoſe acts which are aſcribed to the Power here intended. It cannot be the object of that Fear, nor the author of that Praiſe mentioned <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. The accident, or abſtract power is, indeed, the Reaſon of mens Obligation to the performance of thoſe duties, and the refraining of thoſe injuries to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon empowered; and it is the form, or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple which thoſe acts do flow from in him. But it cannot be that <hi>ſuppoſitum</hi> which is the object of the one, and the agent of the other. Moreover, that the concrete, the perſon in power is here meant, may be clear from the following words in the context, in <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. the Apoſtle puts the title of <hi>Rulers,</hi> and this of <hi>Power</hi> identically, <hi>Rulers are not a terror,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>wilt thou not then be afraid of the Power?</hi> and in <hi>verſ.</hi> 4, 6, 7, 8. his arguments for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the Power in this <hi>verſ.</hi> injoyned run all upon the perſon, <hi>for he is the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of God — he beareth not the ſword in vain,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>It muſt be remembred, that the propriety of a word is not a thing of ſo preciſe a nature, as that it is ever and invariably kept, or ſo as the word may never be obſerved to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe uſed. There is not (I think) any term that is frequently made uſe of, but ſometimes it is taken out of its proper and peculiar ſenſe; and ſo perhaps may be ſometimes this word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>; but as far as I can learn, either by mine own obſervation, or from the incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably more mature experience, and judgement of other Authors, the propriety of this word is of this meaſure, that properly taken, it only ſignifies that power which conſiſts in right, and when it intends a power of Superiority of one perſon over another, it ſignifies an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized power only, or that Superiority which is lawful, or juſtly intitled to rule. And I believe (if poſſible) it will not be eaſie, or obvious to meet with it in any other accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the New Teſtament.</p>
                     <p>For the former, mine own obſervation; I ſhall not trouble the Reader with reciting the places of Scripture in which the word is found, whereby the conſtant uſe of it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; but ſhall ſum up under a few heads the variety of uſe which I have noted in the word in reſpect of divers objects it is apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, and refer to the ſeveral places for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſall.</p>
                     <p>I have noted that in the new Teſtament this word <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>Theſe are the ſeveral kinds of objects or matters (in my obſervation) to which the Power ſignified by this word <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>Firſt, That in all theſe places, the ſenſe of this word <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:114672:28"/> extended to the bare act of meer Occupation, or forcible poſſeſſion, or command: hence it is rendred by our Tranſlators, not alwayes by the word Power, but (in the forecited places) ſometimes by this term, Right, [as <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12. <hi>in marg. Rev.</hi> 22.14.] ſometimes Authority, [<hi>Mat.</hi> 21.23. <hi>Mark</hi> 13.34. <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.36. &amp; 9.1. &amp; 20.20. <hi>Act.</hi> 26.12. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.24. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.8.] and ſometimes Liberty, [as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.9.] And further in divers of thoſe Texts it is put to ſignifie the Right, or Warranted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a thing, when as the point of Right is either queſtioned, or aſſerted in a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinction to an arbritrary, and unwarranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble aſſuming, or uſurping.

For it is not mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall to the uſe of the word here to ſay, what power <hi>Pilate</hi> really had, or what he had not; but the matter is, what power he thought and meant to aſſert that he had; for the word there muſt needs bear that ſenſe which the ſpeaker meant it in: and for that there is no doubt but <hi>Pilate</hi> looked on himſelf, as the lawful, Governor of that place, and at Chriſt as a common perſon of that Nation, and ſo intended; that himſelf was the competent Judge, of the perſon and cauſe of Chriſt then before him, and that he had therefore power to crucifie him, and power to releaſe him, <hi>viz.</hi> reſpectively, accordingly as he ſhould finde his cauſe to deſerve.]</p>
                     <p>So [in that of <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.21.] the Apoſtle diſputing for the equity and juſtneſs of Gods purpoſes, and proceedings in his acts of Free Election and Reprobation, in order to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of his Grace, and in his excutions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he alleadges by way of compariſon the example of the Potters <hi>power</hi> over his clay, to make a veſſel of it to what uſe he pleaſeth. Where if the word <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>Secondly, The other thing I obſerve is, that this word is in thoſe forequoted places put for ſuch a power, as doth not neceſſarily
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:114672:29"/> import, or require to its being, or depend upon poſſeſſion, actual tenure, or exerciſe of the matter, or object of the power, but is in ſome of thoſe inſtances <hi>de facto</hi> ſeparate, and in all ſeparable therefrom; yea in ſome of them the power is ſo affirmed, as that the act or exerciſe of it is expreſly ſecluded, and laid aſide, as neither done, nor to be done in the particular caſe. That univerſal <hi>Power</hi> which Chriſt aſſumeth to himſelf [<hi>Joh.</hi> 17.2. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18.] was then in him in regard of grant and inveſture, and in reſpect of right and title to all the things to which it refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, but a <hi>jus in re,</hi> a ſeiſure or poſſeſſion of them he had not. For before his paſſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then in the ſtate of humiliation, he was far from an actual dominion, or command over all; nay after his riſing again, and his aſcending up unto, and ſeſſion at the right hand of God in heaven; the Apoſtle ſaith of him, <hi>We ſee not yet all things put under him,</hi> [<hi>Heb.</hi> 2.8.] That <hi>power</hi> of Believers to eate of things unto Idols, And that of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> to marry, and to take with them in their travail Wives, and to receive maintenance for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and them of the Churches of <hi>Corinth</hi> and <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> [1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.9. &amp; 9.4, 5. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.9.] theſe were <hi>powers</hi> inherent in thoſe perſons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively, but they were not acted, no nor could lawfully be put forth by them as the caſe then ſtood with thoſe Chriſtians.</p>
                     <p>It is againſt this Obſervation of the force of this word objected by ſome, that <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p n="1">1. It ſhould ſtill be remembred (what was before ſaid) that the propriety of a word is not a thing of ſo preciſe a nature, as that it is ever punctually kept; and that it is to be
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:114672:29"/> judged, not by its uſe once or twice, but by its common and frequent uſe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Let the Texts brought for this be ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally looked into.</p>
                     <p>For that [of <hi>Luke</hi> 4.6.] I can ſee no reaſon to conclude the word is there uſed for a right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs power. Who can think but that Satan there intendeth to aſſume to himſelf a good ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and juſt intereſt over this worlds kingdoms, and not a falſe or uſurped claim? and according to his intention that ſpeaks muſt the ſenſe of the word be conſtrued to be. Indeed he lyed in taking that large compoſs of power to himſelf, and this he had done whether he had ſpoken of that power in point of right, or in point of fact, for in neither ſenſe had be all that power either given to him, or to give to others; but his lie had not been ſo ſpecious or to his purpoſe, had he not meant of a real and good authority.</p>
                     <p>For that [of <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.2, 4.] where it's ſaid <hi>The Dragon gave the beaſt his power, and his ſeat, and great authority; and the Dragon gave power unto the beaſt:</hi> preſuppoſing that by the <hi>Dragon</hi> is meant <hi>Satan,</hi> and by the <hi>Beaſt</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, as diſtributed into ten Kingdoms, or States, upon the diſſipation of the Monarchy of the <hi>Caeſars,</hi> by the wars of the <hi>Barbarians;</hi> which ten are therefore, it may be, called one Kingdom, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.17. or that part of the ſaid Empire, which is called the Weſtern Empire, as reduced partly in regard of ſecular State and Title into the hands of the <hi>Exarch</hi> of <hi>Ravenna</hi> firſt, then of the <hi>French,</hi> and after of the <hi>German</hi> Emperor, but acted, and over-ſwayed by the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi>

Now where it is ſaid, this Dragon gave this Beaſt <hi>his</hi> power, and ſeat, and great authority, the poſſeſſive <hi>his,</hi> is I take it neceſſarily to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the <hi>Dragon,</hi> not to the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> for the pronoun <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:114672:30"/> Now the <hi>Dragon</hi> might be ſaid to give his power and authority to the <hi>Beaſt</hi> two wayes.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. By way of ſurceaſe, or ſurrendry. The Devill when he ſaw the authority of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Emperors come to an end, upon the riſing up of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> he layd down that ſway he had held in the uſe of them, in whom he had played the <hi>Dragon,</hi> by inſtigating them, and their people by them, to groſſe Paganiſh Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, and to open enmity againſt Chriſtianity, and now gave way to the <hi>Beaſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. By way of allurement and aſſiſtance. Satan ſeeing he muſt perforce leave that his way of working, and leading the world which he had long held by means of the Heatheniſh Empire, he now applies himſelf to the preſent Secular powers, the Chriſtian Potentates, riſen up in the room of the former, to draw them over to his intereſt of Idol-worſhip, and Saint-perſecution, though in another forme and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod; unto which be makes it his deſign firſt to perſwade, and then to aſſiſt them, in the promoting and executing thereof. In reference, to the latter his aſſiſtance, eſpecially, may thoſe words be underſtood of the <hi>Dragons giving his power and authority to the Beaſt q. d.</hi> Satan joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth his power unto the <hi>Roman</hi> State or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy, become Chriſtian, and after a while degenerate in Religion, by Hereſie, and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, to further them in their way (which was alſo his own main work) of Blaſphemous Idolatries, and cruel perſecutions, drawing in alſo the Nations of the world to follow them therein. A like manner of ſpeech to this we have, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.13, 17. where the <hi>ten Kings</hi> are ſaid to <hi>give their power and ſtrength unto the Beaſt;</hi> that is, by way, not of inveſting it in him, but of aſſiſting him with it. And thus it may be plain how the word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, is here uſed. For what is that Power, Seat, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which Satan hath in humane affairs?
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:114672:30"/> Verily none properly ſo called; that is, he hath no temporal Government, no formal, profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, open, and acknowledged rule amongſt men, either by commanding in word, or compulſion in deed, as Princes have over their Subjects, Maſters over their Servants. The term there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot here be put to ſignifie any Civil Empire, either lawful or unlawful, as to title. The Devill hath indeed a phyſical power, or potency in material or elementary things, to produce effects in them above the ordinary courſe of nature; and there is in him a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly political or governing Power, in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his fellows, the evill ſpirits, and hence we read of his <hi>Angels;</hi> and him called, <hi>the prince of Devils:</hi> But in moral, and humane proceedings, he hath no more but a ſuggeſting or counſelling, a tempting or perſwaſive power: the only way he hath to ſway men after him (that we know) is by illuſion and enticement. When therefore we finde theſe titles, <hi>the God, and the Ruler of the darkneſs of this world, the prince of this world, and the prince of the power of the air,</hi> aſcribed to him, and here <hi>a power, ſeat, and great authority,</hi> which he lends in aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to the <hi>Beaſt;</hi> we muſt take theſe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions figuratively, and improperly ſpoken; and to import no more, but that, as it were, and in effect, he is, and hath theſe things, in as much as by his ſtratagems, or ſubtile arts, he leadeth men both of high and low degree, in a manner at his pleaſure; and by crafty inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuations, he is as prevalent, and bringeth men as wholly to his bent, as if he had a direct Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire over them, and they owned him as their Lord. Satans power being then ſpiritual, not temporal, perſwaſive or precarious, not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious, his <hi>giving his power to the Beaſt,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by reſignation at the Beaſts advancement, or by way of aſſiſtance to him when in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and in relation to his uſe thereof, as

                     <p>Laſtly, for thoſe places [<hi>Eph.</hi> 6.12. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.15.] <hi>Principalities,</hi> and <hi>Powers,</hi> are the titles both of good and evill ſpirits, in reference to other ſpirits; there being an order, and a diſtinction of ſuperior and inferior, in reſpect of dignity and rule, among them by cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; the which the fallen Angels doe ſtill retain among them; and this they do (in all probability) both by virtue of their firſt ordination, the preſent diſpenſation of God, and their own mutual conſent: now what power is in any Angel by creation, and primitive inſtitution, cannot be unlawful.</p>

                     <p>That there is a reall difference to be found betwixt thoſe two powers, the Natural, and the Moral; as in general, ſo as they may be ſeated in man as the ſubject, and reſpect man as the object, and particularly as they are competible to a body politique; and that the difference lies, as was ſaid, herein, that the one conſiſts in a meer <hi>impetus,</hi> or prepotency, or a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of ſtrength to impoſe, or make im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on another; the other in a right, or imereſt to bear ſway, may be eaſie to fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="1">1. The reality of the difference is evident, Natural power is found not only in man, but in brute beaſts, yea in inanimates: Moral is proper to reaſonable creatures. Again, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though reaſonable creatures be enduable with both, yet among men the natural and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, might, and right to rule may be, and for the moſt part are diſtinct or ſeparate each from other in regard of the ſubject of inherence<note n="*" place="margin">Poteſtas in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulo, Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat in Senatu.

                        </note>. The Natural power is ordinarily in them that do not, ought nor to rule, but to obey and be in ſubjection. There is a Moral power, or right to rule in Man over the other Creatures, yet in natural power he is inferiour to many of them. And amongſt men, in Natural power, that is ſtrength, or might of body, the family in greater then the Maſter, the Subjects excel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <pb n="17" facs="tcp:114672:32"/> their Soveraign, the Souldiert overmatch their Leaders; whereas the Moral power in relation to each of theſe is in the Maſter, the Soveraign, the Leader. It is very ſeldom ſeen, if ever, in any humane Society, that Natural, and Moral power do meet in the ſame perſons, as the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of inheſion. Suppoſe a City or Nation ruled by ſome ſtrong hand, or a military force: even in that force there muſt needs be ſome one head, or councel of a few to guide, and command it, ſome Pretorian Magiſtracy to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the Army, and in that head or Pretorian office (far inferior in Natutal power to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, as the Army poſſibly is to the City, or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion under its beck) would the ſupreme Power lie, and the military force would but be ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and miniſterial to that command, in like manner as the unarmed people are to that force. And although it be both right, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the well-being of a political Society, that the Natural and Moral power do concur, the former to ſerve and ſupport the other, and the diſcord of theſe is the high way to the ruine of both; yet it is not ſimply neceſſary to the being either of the Moral power, or of the community. Every ſudden mutiny, or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Sedition, which is the Inſurrection, and prevalency of the Natural power againſt the Moral, doth not diſſolve the preſent Society or Magiſtracy, Political, or Military. The uproar at <hi>Epheſus</hi> [<hi>Act.</hi> 19.] was within a few houres quelled, and the City remained in its former ſtate. Although upon the death of <hi>Ahaziah</hi> [2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22.9.] <hi>his houſe had no power (viz.</hi> natural) <hi>to keep ſtill the Kingdom,</hi> but <hi>Athaliah</hi> uſurped it, yet within a few years it removed the uſurpreſſe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed both Power and Kingdom as in its former right.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And that the difference twixt thoſe two Powers lies (as was ſaid) in the meer forcible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:114672:33"/> or prevalidity of the one, and the right or legitimacy to command of the other; that the one can, the other only may or ought to rule; the one poſſibly hath the appetite and act of governing, the other hath only the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and warrant, ſhould me thinks eaſily be conceived. Natural power we oppoſe to impotency, weakneſs; Moral power we op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to illicitneſs or wrong. Thence that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Id tantum poſſumus quod jure poſſumus;</hi> whereby it appears that Natural power conſiſts in ſtrength, Moral in rightfulneſs. And indeed wherein elſe ſhould the difference be placed? What difference is there to be made betwixt the power of one Brute prevailing over another, or over a Man, and that of the owners ruling over that Brute? or betwixt that of a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtealer that hath gotten anothers childe into his hand by ſtealth, and that of the true father over his childe? or betwixt that of a Rout, or Band of Rogues, or drunken companions that may have aſſaulted and beaten the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates officers, and perhaps himſelf too, and that of the Civil Magiſtrate? each of theſe may <hi>de facto</hi> be Maſter; each of them may be found aſſuming, and exerciſing rule; they cannot therefore be diſtinguiſhed by their acts: The d ſtinction then betwixt them muſt be taken from the ground, riſe, or principle from which the acts of rule are put forth; which in the one and the other are divers. In the one thoſe acts are from meer force and will; in the other, they are from authority, or a will authorized to preſcribe or command. Each of theſe Powers (I ſay) may be found exerciſing rule; for we cannot call any power morall, meerly becauſe it acteth in, or manageth thoſe we call Moral or Civil af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; for that a Natural power in a ſubject endued with reaſon may do: there may be an intermedling with Civill matters, where
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:114672:33"/> there is no moral power, as in caſe of Sedition, where they that are to obey will needs rule: as on the other hand there may be a Moral power, that is, a right to command, or diſpoſe where the object is not moral, or civil; ſuch is the power of man, given him of God, over other creatures (animate and inanimate) of diſpoſing according to his reaſon and will, of their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral acts of feeding, generating, labouring, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But that is a moral power in relation to any of theſe objects or matters about which power is exerciſed, which hath a moral riſe or deducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>viz.</hi> an authorization, and right, and what hath not ſo is meerly natural.</p>

                     <p>Unto a moral or authorized power, and ſo to the power intended in the Text, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary not only that the thing to be had and held, or to be acted and done, be in it ſelf law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but that it be lawful to the perſon in whom you ſubject the power, that it be lawfully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted in him, or that there be a due authorizati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or call of the perſon to it.</p>
                     <p>For the yet clearer underſtanding of this, let it be obſerved that there are four ſeveral wayes wherein Power may be ſaid to be lawful or unlawful, warranted or unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. In regard of Matter.</item>
                        <item>2. In regard of Perſon.</item>
                        <item>3. In regard of Title.</item>
                        <item>4. In regard of uſe.</item>
                     </list>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:114672:39"/>
                     <p>Let us take notice wherein each of theſe conſiſteth, and differeth from the other, and how far they, or any of them conduce to the making up of a Moral power.</p>
                     <p>Firſt in regard of Matter. Power is in this reſpect lawful and warranted, when the work or act to be done by it is in its own nature al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, or approved of God to be done by man. The Scripture declares to us a multitude of things which are put into mans power, or are made lawful or warranted to him; as, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, there is <hi>a power to eat, and to drink, to eat fleſh, to eat without diſcriminating betwixt clean and unclean; and to eat without reſpect to an idol conſecration.</hi> [1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.4. <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. &amp; 10.23, 27.] On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary many things are for their matter unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and alſo the power of them is unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted or forbidden to men. Such is the power claimed by the Pope many wayes, as the power of diſpenſing with divine laws, or of making of new in matters of Faith and Religion; the power of judiciary binding the conſcience, or forgiving ſins; the power of an Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical ſupremacy over all Chriſtians; the power of diſpoſing of ſouls in another world: theſe are ſuper-humane acts, or ſuch as were never concredited to man. Such again is the power of Witchcraft, Sorcery, falſe miracles, Divination, and the like preſtigiatory deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or pernicious ſeats, practiſed by men from their own preſumption with the aſſiſtance or inſtigation of the Devil.</p>
                     <p>Secondly in regard of Perſon. There are in Scripture ſome Powers lawful for the matter of them, but variable in point of warrant as to the perſon, the tenure of them being allowed to one ſort of perſons, and inhibited to others; ſome perſons only are made competent, and others are diſenabled to aſſume them; and conſequently in the perſons capable to hold
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:114672:39"/> them they are lawful powers, in others not ſo. The Prieſthood of the Law was inveſted in the ſons of <hi>Aaron,</hi> with excluſion of all other: if any therefore beſides them ſhould have taken to them that function (as did <hi>Korah</hi> and his company) there was a power unlawful in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of perſon. The Miniſtry of the word, or Office of teaching in the Church is expreſly forbidden to women.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.35. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.11, 12.</note> If then a woman ſhould take up this work (as ſome, they ſay, of late have done, and as the <hi>Pepaſians, Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillians,</hi> and <hi>Maxionites</hi> are ſaid to allow and practiſe<note n="*" place="margin">

Maſter <hi>Knox</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> held a woman uncapable (otherwiſe then by extraordinary call) of Civil Magiſtracy, or Supreme rule<note n="†" place="margin">Hiſtory of the Reformation of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> pag. <hi>220. &amp; 311.</hi>

                        </note>: and others conceive it ſimply prohibited by our Saviour unto a Miniſter of the Goſpel, by thoſe words of his [<hi>Matth.</hi> 20.26.] According to theſe opinions if a Woman, or if a Miniſter ſhould undertake the Civill power (however humanely admitted to it) their power would be unlawful in regard of Perſon.</p>
                     <p>This is a ſecond way of a powers lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and unlawfulneſs. Where note, that under this head the perſon is conſidered in <hi>ſpecie,</hi> or in ſome common condition, or rank, for as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o perſons individual warrant, or the want of it, that's reducible to the next parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, in regard of Title. A power may be in it ſelf, or for matter abſtracted from perſons lawful, and a perſon may be in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon qualified for inveſture with it, that is, as capable to receive it as another, but all this makes not this or that man a Moral power. There muſt be put one thing more to both theſe to conſtitute an authorized or lawful, and ſo a moral power; and that is a right or title to rule.</p>
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:114672:40"/>
                     <p>This is of the nature and eſſence of Moral power; for what is Authority, but a right to Rule? As private dominion or property con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in a right to employ, and diſpoſe of the thing owned; ſo publique dominion or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity conſiſts in a title to rule.</p>
                     <p>That right or title is neceſſary to all tenure, or to Civil dominion in general; or, that ſuch right in moſt worldly things conſiſts in a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial property, or ſequeſtration of the things from common claim, and uſe to one, or ſome peculiar perſons, it may ſeem too much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſive and not needful to go about here to prove. For however ſome things by reaſon either of their vaſtneſs, and inexhauſtibleneſs, or their joint-occupyableneſs by all without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption to any, are expoſed to the common, arbitrary, and promiſcuous uſe of every man, as are the great Ocean, the light, the air; and however at the beginning of the World, and for ſome time after, by reaſon of the fewneſs and ſimplicity of mank<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nde, dominion or right, in reſpect of the objects, was not reduced to diſtinct property; yet now, upon the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of occupants (beſides the emergent pravity, into which men are lapſed) in moſt things dominion, or right is ſtated by ſequeſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or peculiar appropriation; and that doubtleſs agreeably to the law of Nature, and from the dictate of right Reaſon, and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral agreement of all men that are but ſound witted, and any thing moralized. Yea it is delivered to us by Scripture to be the act of God, <hi>The earth hath he given to the children of men, [Pſal.</hi> 115.16.] he hath given it, as the experience of this, and all precedent ages diſcoverable to us, tell us, not to be catched up as fodder and harbor are by brute beaſts in the Wilderneſs, among whom the ſtronger and fiercer ſeize on what, and where they pleaſe, the weaker take only what the other
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:114672:40"/> leave them; but under a rule of equity and right ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionated or diſtributed by property: according to that of St. <hi>Paul, He hath determined the bounds of thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                     <p>But to follow this Argument only with applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to our particular ſubject. Amongſt the things that are ſubjected to property, or a ſeq<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ds be one, yea, and that more, or rather then other things. For, though other things in the firſt age of the world migh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> have been common: as ſoon as ever ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, or other domeſtick or civill ſocieties were inſtituted, he rights of the correlatives of theſe ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties were diſtinguiſht, and appropriate; neither could it be other ways: for whereas there was poſſible to be a community of right, or uſe at the beginning in things of ordinary and external poſſeſſion, whether moveable or immoveable, yet in matter of authority this could never be: It is repugnant to the nature of the thing; it cannot exiſt without the ſubjection of ſome determinate perſons to it; and you muſt of neceſſity put, and tie up authority, and ſubjection in diſtinct and ſeveral ſubjects, ſo as it may be ſaid, this man is to command, and theſe are to obey; whereupon it is inevitably to be yeelded, that autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity conſiſts in a right or title to rule appropriate to one, or ſome certain perſons, &amp; reſerved from others.</p>
                     <p>That to the producing, or conſtituting of a moral power (whether Civil Magiſtracy, or any other) there muſt go the entitling or intereſting of the perſons to it, or an inveſting him, or them with a right thereto, may be thus further manifeſt.</p>
                     <p>All Moral power is derived from God as the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain or Author. That which the Apoſtle here ſaith of the Civil Magiſtracy <hi>in ſpecie; There is no power but of God, the powers that he are ordained of God,</hi> is true of all power in general, and he might have ſo expreſly extended it, had his ſcope in this place
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:114672:41"/> been ſo large. Gods derivation of authority to men muſt needs import two things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. His inſtitution of authority in the general, with the ſeveral ſpecies of it, as conjugal, parental, herile, magiſtraticall.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. His communicating, conferring or convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that power, which he hath ſo inſtituted to be, to particular perſons.</p>
                     <p>There muſt be this latter as well as the former to the real &amp; actual conſtituting of an authority, or put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it into exiſtence. Gods ordaining at the firſt the conjugal, parental, herile, and political power, that is, his appointing that the husband, parent, maſter, or prince ſhal have authority over their reſpective corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latives (ſuppoſe by thoſe words of the commandment, <hi>Honour thy Father,</hi> &amp;c.) doth not of it ſelf put any of thoſe authorities in being, or in one perſon more then another; or it makes no man a husband, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, maſter, or Prince. Wherefore, if we will make this good, which cannot be denyed, that all Power, <hi>viz.</hi> Authority, is derived from God, we muſt ſay God doth by ſome act of his (beſides his allowing or preſcribing Government, with ſuch and ſuch <hi>ſpecies</hi> of it to be) convey authority to individuals, or particular perſons. It muſt further be acknowledged that this act of God muſt be ſuch as that by it, not only the perſon authorized, but the reſt that are concerned in that eſtate, in point o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> uſe of it, or duty to it, may underſtand that ſuch an one is ſingled out by God to ſuſtain this authority. How elſe could any in conſcience of Gods ordinance, either aſſume ſuch authority over others to themſelves, rather then yeeld it to others, or others attribute it to them rather then to others, or to themſelves? Now can it be imagined how ſuch an act of God ſo humanely intelligible ſhould be paſſed, but either it muſt be by his immediate revelation from heaven, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by indigitating, or pointing out (as it were) ſuch a perſon, or perſons to ſuch an authority, in ſuch a place; or by chalking out a way to men, or giving rules in general to them, how ſuch and ſuch authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:114672:41"/> ſhall accrew unto men; which wayes or rules ſhall ſerve in all caſes (unleſſe where himſelf ſhall immediately interpoſe) to create ſuperiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or convey power to men, and to diſcover the empowered.</p>
                     <p>The former way, Gods deſignation of particular perſons unto authority by immediate revelation from heaven, is not now exerciſed or expected, neither was it ever in ordinary, or conſtant uſe. The latter therefore is the way remaining to us.</p>
                     <p>That there are ſuch wayes ſtated, or rules pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by God for mens entry into relations of power over others, and thoſe neceſſary to the being thereof, ſo as without them all ordinary claims to ſuch conditions are null, is very evident, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed in the relations of parents, maſters, hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, paſtors of the Church, and many others; and there is no reaſon in the earth (to me excogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) to think it is not certainly ſo alſo in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtratical ſtate; What thoſe rules or wayes in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular are, in reference to Civil Magiſtracy, here is not the fit place to enter upon the ſet enquiry, but I ſhall for this have fuller opportunity (as alſo for the proving more largely that ſuch rules there are given of God) afterward in this diſcourſe. But if thus much be admitted (as I ſee not how it will be gainſayed) it ſufficeth to prove the thing we are about, <hi>viz.</hi> that the eſſence of Moral power conſiſts in a title, or right to rule. For if all power be from God, not only as appointing, the office to be among men, but as appointing the perſon, or perſons to the office: and his ordinary, conſtant way of appointing the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to the office, be the preſcribing of a rule for mens ingreſſe into the authoritative relation, or acceſſion to power, by which way he communicates that power to them which is not in others, and which otherwiſe is not in them, it muſt needs be that as ſuch admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance unto power moſt certainly gives right and title to it, ſo upon mens having, or not having ſuch
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:114672:42"/> entrance to it depends the reality, or nullity of the power they to) themſelves challenge. We have ſeen this third kind of lawfulneſs or warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs of power (<hi>viz.</hi> in regard of Title) and the neceſſity of it to the being or conſtituting of a moral power.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, there is yet behind another way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in power may be ſaid to be lawful, or unlawful, <hi>viz.</hi> in regard of uſe. That power which in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect both of matter, and of perſon, and of title is lawful, is yet to undergoe a further qualification to regulate it, which concernes the uſe, or employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it: a power lawful, and right for its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure muſt alſo be legal, and right for its practiſe; its courſe, and proceſſe in government muſt be altogether juſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it may decree, and do only equal and right things, and in this reſpect that power is unlawful, or culpable which doth enact, or execute any injuſtice or wrong. So were thoſe <hi>ten Kings, [Rev.</hi> 17.13, 14.] who <hi>gave their power up to ſerve the Beaſt, and to make war with the Lamb.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But among theſe four wayes of the lawfulneſs and unlawfulneſs of a power, which we have thus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed of and explained, there is this difference to be noted. The three firſt wayes do concern the being, compoſition, habit, and conſtitution of an authority or Moral power; the fourth only concerns the act and exerciſe thereof: and conſequently the three firſt conditions of lawfulneſs are ſimply ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the making of the power, the fourth is but accidental; and exterior to its making; an unlawfulneſs in any of thoſe three reſpects is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible with, deſtructive to the nature of a moral power, and conſequently ſecludeth the power that is in any of thoſe things peccant from any claim to this text; whereas that power which only offends in its uſe, or acts of power, may well, as to its being, and conſtitution be moral, and intereſted in the text, and its univerſal actings only be accounted forein, or diſallowed ground therein. For this is
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:114672:42"/> (as far as I have obſerved) yeelded by all, and is very certain, that every unlawful power, ſo far as it is unlawful, muſt be excluded out of the meaning of this text<note n="*" place="margin">See the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors quoted by Mr. <hi>Prinne,</hi> his third part of the Power of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aments, p. <hi>14.</hi>
                        </note>. The power therefore that is unlawful as to its being, and conſtitution, is wholly and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely ſecluded; the power that is unlawful only as to exerciſe may be for its habit, or being inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in it, and its irregular acts only diſcarded from it.</p>
                     <p>To make this obſervation (if need be) yet more evident, as to that lawfulneſſe which concerns the being of a power. Unto the conſtitution of a power in its individual eſſence and exiſtence, you muſt neceſſary take in theſe three things:
<list>
                           <item>1. The matter of the power.</item>
                           <item>2. A ſubject or perſon to ſuſtain it.</item>
                           <item>3. An inveſture or conveying of that matter of power unto that ſubject or perſon.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>If all theſe three muſt go to the making of a power, then a legitimacy in every of theſe muſt go to the making of a Moral power; or a power law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in its conſtitution or being; and an illegiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy in any of theſe is an illegitimacy in the very being, and ſo a nullity to the power as moral, or a making of it no authority.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. An unlawfulneſs in the matter of a power de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyes its moral being. The Pope aſſumes to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a power to diſpenſe with the conſciences of Chriſtians in divine Lawes. This power, we ſay, is unlawful for the matter, or in the whole kind of it diſallowed to all, and every one of mankinde: and therefore we ſay it's null; we deny any ſuch power to be in him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. An unlawfulneſs in regard of perſon evacuates the power. <hi>Korah</hi> and his company arrogated to themſelves the office of the prieſthood; this power, lawful in it ſelf, as for the matte, was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but prohibited to be in them; their Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood therefore was a nullity, they were indeed no prieſts.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="38" facs="tcp:114672:43"/>3. Let there be a power lawful for matter, and a perſon capable, or induable with it, yet if there be not a lawful inveſture, or conveyance of this power to this perſon, there is yet in him no moral power; an unlawful, entry, or tenure nullifies the power in that reſpect. <hi>John Becold</hi> (called <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Leyden</hi>) takes upon him in Munſter to be King, and as King acteth and ruleth all at his pleaſure; this King being deſtitute of a juſt call, title, or tenure, was therefore but ſcenical, and nothing as to a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral power, or real magiſtracy; he was in truth no King, but a traiterous Villain; the unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs here is in the conſtitution of the power; that his having, and holding the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Soveraignty, that his being in power was unlawful.</p>
                     <p>In any of theſe three wayes of unlawful power, you cannot ſever the unlawfulneſs from the being of the power; take away that which is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in any of them, take away the matter, or take away the perſon, or take away the tenure, and you deſtroy the very being of the power. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, in the third (which moſt concerns our purpoſe) where one takes and holds the place of Power without right, or title, the thing which is here unlawful is the very tenure, or holding of power; if then you will take away that which is unlawful, you muſt take away the perſons tenure, or holding of power, and ſo you take away the being of this power. No otherwiſe is an unentitled tenure taken away, but either by depoſing the unlawful poſſeſſor, or by crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to him <hi>de novo,</hi> a juſt title, and confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring on him a right: now either of theſe two wayes the power that was unlawfully occupyed ceaſeth.</p>
                     <p>If then it be granted that from this Text is excluded every unlawful power ſo far as it is unlawful, or whatever in the power is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; Seeing the unlawfulneſs of a rightleſs, or unentitled power, is in the being of it, not in
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:114672:43"/> the exerciſe meerly, and for that reaſon the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulneſs is inſeparable from the power, it muſt needs be that an unentitled power is utterly and abſolutely excluded from the meaning of this Text: or, in ſhort, ſeeing the being of the power is unlawful, the being of the power muſt be ſhut out of our text. In this reſpect the reaſon is the ſame betwixt an act of injuſtice of a power lawful as to title or conſtitution, and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt occupants act of being in, or holding the power; betwixt <hi>Ahabs</hi> ſeiſing of <hi>Naboths</hi> vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, and <hi>Athaliahs</hi> intruding into <hi>Joaſh</hi> his kingdom, the one is an act of Tyranny as to exerciſe, the other is an act of Tyranny as to title. You cannot otherwiſe either give admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to the Text, and to the ordination of God, or deny it unto the one, then you may do to the other: if you ſay the unlawfulneſs of oppreſſion excludes <hi>Ahabs</hi> act from this Text, I may with as good reaſon ſay the unlawfulneſs of wrongful occupation excludes <hi>Athaliahs</hi> act, which is her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in power from the ſame.</p>

               <p>THeſe words, <hi>of God, ordained of God,</hi> are the two Predicates or things which in this ſentence are enunciated, or ſpoken of the ſubject, <hi>the power.</hi> And they are the <hi>medius ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus,</hi> or the bottome or ground of the argument; the firſt and principal argument which the Apoſtle in this his diſcourſe of the ſubjects duty to the Civil Magiſtrate, bringeth for ſubjection to the higher powers. And they are a medium of a very great force and authority: being they offer to conſideration the higheſt deſcent, origination or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivation of the powers here pleaded for, <hi>viz.</hi> that they are <hi>of God, ordain'd of God.</hi> Theſe terms then are of a very main, and material importance; and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining and clearing of the ſenſe of them cannot but be chiefly neceſſary and uſeful.</p>
               <p>It will eaſily be granted only thoſe <hi>Powers</hi> are here intended unto which theſe predicates <hi>(of God, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained of God)</hi> are truly, and in the ſenſe of the Apoſtle in this place attributable. The buſineſs then will be to enquire, How theſe words muſt be here taken, and what is their ſpecial meaning in this place.</p>
               <p>Both of theſe terms refer the ſubject they are ſpoken of, <hi>the pow rs that be,</hi> unto God as the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of them; but the former doth it in a more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral word,<note place="margin">Pareus Tolet.</note> the latter more expreſly; the latter therefore may be, and is by Expoſitors taken as the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:114672:44"/> explication and limitation of the former. We will firſt examine the former, the more general term, <hi>of God,</hi> and after deſcend to the following, the more ſpecial notification of the powers derivation, <hi>ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of God.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>THere is no power but of God.</hi> This phraſe, <hi>of God,</hi> is of a divers acceptation and uſe, both in Scripture and in Theology. That we may come the more clearly to the meaning of it in this text, I ſhall endevour, firſt to ſum up the different uſes of it in Scripture, as I have collected them.</p>
                  <p>In the general all the wayes of the being of things of God may be reduced under two heads, that is, [1. <hi>Of his hand.</hi> 2. <hi>Of his mouth.</hi>] or, [1. <hi>Of his work.</hi> 2. <hi>Of his word.</hi>] or, [1. <hi>Of his doing.</hi> 2. <hi>Of his declaring.</hi>] But then each of theſe may be ſubdiſtinguiſhed.</p>
                  <p>Of the former, the being of a thing <hi>of Gods hand, work, or doing</hi> (which we ordinarily call his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence) we muſt again diſtinguiſh. It may be taken either,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In a more general and large ſenſe, ſo as to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port only that ſome diſpoſings or proceedings of God, are the antecedent or occaſion upon which certain things come to paſſe.

                     <hi>to deceive; to put a lying ſpirit in the mouth of ſome; to ſend an evil ſpirit between men; to powre out upon men the ſpirit of deep ſleep, and to cloſe their eyes; to lead men into temptation; to ſend men ſtrong deluſions that they ſhould believe a lie; to bid a wicked man curſe a righteous; to ſtir up and to ſend men when they enterpriſe, and go on ſinful atchievements; to turn the hearts of men, and to put in their hearts to do evil.</hi> Not as if he poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively acted theſe things, or efficaciouſly infuſed them into men, <hi>he will not do iniquity, he tempteth not any man,</hi> but in as much as he leaveth men to themſelves and to Satan, he layeth no impediments upon their power, or active reſtraint upon their wils; yea, he ſo ordereth outward occurrences, as that they meet with fit occaſion and ſuiteable inducements to thoſe evils, (which his carriage to men he predetermineth before to uſe for holy ends, and moſt righteouſly, and foreſeeth infallibly what men will thereupon do) hence therefore their running into thoſe ſins is (in a large and leſſe proper ſenſe) ſaid to be of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, things are ſaid to be of God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntially, or <hi>of his hand, worke, and doing,</hi> more directly, or in a more proper and poſitive accepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that is, ſo as he is the author, or efficient cauſe of them, or ſo as they are not meerly from his working providence, as the hint or occaſion only, but from him as the worker, or agent producing them, or putting them <hi>in rerum naturâ.</hi> Thus all poſitive beings are of God. [<hi>Rom.</hi> 11.36. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.10.] that is, the exiſtence of all individuals or ſingulars, with all their motions, effluxes or actions, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.28. whether the agents be irrational, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.29 or moral, rational and free, [<hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.29. <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.1, 9. &amp; 20.24. &amp; 21.1.] and all the conditions, and events; all the evil; and all the good that befals

                  <p>And things are this way of God, <hi>viz.</hi> of his direct and poſitive proceeding two wayes:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By his ordinary providence, or as he work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in, and by natural cauſes, and in a natural courſe, as in the aforegiven inſtances.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In a way of ſupernatural efficiency, or work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Grace. So perſons are of him in their eſtate of Grace, [1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.19. 3 <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.] and ſo the gracious effects that are in perſons, are of him, [2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18: &amp; 2.17. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.14.] the former way the Schools call his <hi>general,</hi> the latter his <hi>ſpecial</hi> concourſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>of God,</hi> ſignifies <hi>of Gods mouth, word, or declaring:</hi> a thing is ſaid to be of God that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth out of his mouth, or is ſpoken, or uttered by him. Now we muſt note, the things that proceed out of the mouth of God are more princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally of two ſorts, in as much as the mouth or word of God is a declaration of his will, and the will of God is diſtinguiſht by a twofold accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt is, his <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or will of Decree, or that will which himſelf purpoſeth to execute, or have to be.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond is his <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or his Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive or preceptive will, which delivereth the rule or law which man is to do, or walk by. Hence it is, that the declarations of the mouth of God are ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly twofold, and of two ſorts of things. [1. Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive or manifeſting. 2. Imperative or regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.] Under the firſt ſort are compriſed all the diſcoveries of Gods own wayes, and works, or of what God himſelf hath done, doth, or will do; all the revelations or propheſies of Gods proceedings, paſt, preſent, and to come; all Divine hiſtories, promiſes, threatnings, or other predictions. <hi>That</hi>
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:114672:46"/> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>which I have heard of the Lord of hoſts, the God of Iſrael, have I declared unto you, [Iſa.</hi> 21.10.] Under the latter head, the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of his Imperative, or regulating will, are contained all his Commandements, or conceſſions unto men; whatſoever God injoynes or allowes man to do, or not to do; all divine warrants, commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, precepts, or permiſſions touching humane acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and affairs. According to this laſt acception that is of God that is authorized by him unto men; that is not of God, which he diſapproveth, prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, or warranteth not unto men.</p>
                  <p>Let us, in reference to the latter, the being of a thing of Gods mouth by way of declaring his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving or authorizing will, obſerve, for explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſake, ſome inſtances of both ſorts, <hi>viz.</hi> both Poſitive and Negative out of Scripture.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. According to this ſenſe both perſons and things are affirmed to be of God.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Perſons are owned thus to be of God; that is, to be authorized, and approved of him to be in their reſpective ſtates and places. <hi>Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God,</hi> ſaith <hi>Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> unto Jeſus, [<hi>Joh.</hi> 3.2.] and <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>He that is of God, he hath ſeen the Father, [Joh.</hi> 6.46.] <hi>If this man were not of God, he could do nothing,</hi> ſaith the blind man of Chriſt, [<hi>Joh.</hi> 9.33.] And the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> often hath this phraſe, <hi>Try the ſpirits whether they are of God, every ſpirit that confeſſeth that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh is of God. Ye are of God little children, —we are of God,</hi> [1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.1, 2, 4, 6. &amp; 5.19.]</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As perſons, ſo wayes, doctrines, and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are in this acceptation ſaid to be of God. <hi>If any man</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>will do his will, he ſhall know of the Doctrine whether it be of God, or whether I ſpeak of my ſelf, [Joh.</hi> 7.17.] <hi>If this counſel or this work be of God, ye cannot overthrow it,</hi> quoth the Doctor in the councel at <hi>Jeruſalem, [Act.</hi> 5.38, 39.] And <hi>David</hi> ſaid of his enterpriſe of bringing up the Ark of God to his C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ty; <hi>If it ſeem good unto you, and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:114672:46"/> that it be of the Lord our God, Let us ſend,</hi> &amp;c. [1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 13.2.] A parallel phraſe to this of being of God is that of <hi>being from Heaven,</hi> in diſtinction from that which is <hi>of men.</hi> As in that queſtion of our Saviour to the chief Prieſts, [<hi>Mat.</hi> 21.25.] <hi>The baptiſm of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Negatively, in this ſenſe many both perſons, and things are denyed to be of God.</p>

By his general, or, 2. By his ſpecial concourſe. Or ſecondly of his mouth, and word, and ſo a thing, may be of God, 1. Either Narratively: 2. or, Legiſlatively, and by way of authorization, approbation, or warrant to men. And this laſt way Scripture declares, 1.

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:114672:50"/> are, and particularly man is morally ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to him; <hi>viz.</hi> as he receives all his activity from him, ſo he is to act by his Commiſſion, and in a conformity to his direction, or command given forth by word: the ground and reaſon of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſubordination is his being a creature; for as ſuch he totally depends on God for his being and operation; the latter is from his being a creature endued with reaſon and will, and therefore working with deliberation and free volition; thence his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and actions are qualifiable with a moral good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and evilneſs, and are capable of being regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a law, and proſecuted with rewards and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments. Man therefore in reſpect of his moral actions, ſtands in this twofold ſubordination unto God, phyſical, and moral.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. There are divers differences twixt theſe two ſubordinations of man unto God, ſome of which it is to our preſent purpoſe to conſider. They are different.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In the formall reſpect, or term to which they refer; the phyſical ſubordination reſpecteth Gods will of purpoſe, and hand of providence; the moral reſpecteth Gods revealed will, or word of precept.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In point of neceſſity, the phyſical ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is certain and immutable, ſo neceſſary as that it cannot be otherwiſe, it is impoſſible the creature ſhould not be in all things ſubject to, dependent on Gods decree and hand of providence, both paſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and actively: the moral is not ſo, but may be, and is varied from, though this ſubordination be neceſſary <hi>de jure,</hi> and ought to be kept inviolate, yet it is not <hi>de facto,</hi> but it is oftentimes infringed. And here comes in ſin; what is ſin but the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures breach, and tranſgreſſion of the moral ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination he ſtands in, and owes unto God his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive will or word, either by a non acting, or by a contrary acting to the ſame?</p>
                     <p n="6">6. By theſe differences it may appear (for I ſhall not ſtrive to take notice of all) that theſe two ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinations
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:114672:51"/> are in humane actions, not only diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhable, but ſeparable and diſſociable. Man may be ſubordinate to God phyſically in thoſe actions wherein he is inordinate morally. And Gods will of purpoſe, and work of providence may go on, and be done, when his preceptive will takes no place, but is directly croſſed, as it is in all the ſinful motions of man. And hence it may appear of the ſinfull acts of men, as they are ſomething <hi>in rerum naturâ,</hi> how it may be ſaid (as in the third Propoſition above) the thing is of Gods hand working, but not of his mouth warranting it to man.</p>
                     <p>If it be here asked, Why God makes uſe of ſuch agents to act by, as are diſpleaſing and croſſe to his preceptive will, when as he hath ſuch choice of other miniſterial agents, yea, and makes uſe of his creatures agency meerly of choice, not of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity?</p>
                     <p>I anſwer, though mans ſinful acts cannot but be diſpleaſing and diſhonorable to him, yet the uſe he can, and doth make of them, is not ſo. It is for his honour to work by variety of inſtruments, and the commendation of his workmanſhip to bring to paſſe a ſtraight and perfect work, with crooked and untoward tooles. His providences of this nature are the probations of men, both good and evil; and hereby he both worketh out more good then there is evill in the act of the ſubordinate agent ſo peccant, and accompliſheth the juſt puniſhment, both of others and of thoſe he ſo imployes.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. We muſt obſerve in the ſubordination of the creature to God in its production, though it receive all its efficacy and working from God, yet the cauſality of the firſt and ſecond, of the ſuperiour and inferiour cauſe, and the efflux of the effect as from the one, and the other, are diſtinguiſhable. As the creatures eſſence, and exiſtence are wholly in and from God, yet far enough different, and diſtinct from Gods: ſo the creatures power and operation, unto the cauſing of an effect, is totolly received of God, yet Gods agency therein is one, and the creatures is
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:114672:51"/> another. Hence our ſenſe tels us the ſun ſhines, the fire warmes, chalke whitens, and it is ſo really. If we ſhould ſay (as many Schoolmen do) that in this ſubordinate agency of the creature under G d, and their working together unto any effect,<note place="margin">Molina.

That God and the creature are different agents in their producing of the ſame effect is granted, but how ſhould they be ſo, if their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or agents were altogether the ſame? Beſides, if it were ſo, then the ſame action muſt be ſaid to be morally good (<hi>viz.</hi> as from God) and evill (as from man) to be ſubordinate to a law (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s from man) not ſubordinate (as from God). Again, if in this concurrence of theſe two agents to the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the ſame effect, the action of each were wholly the ſame, then the ſame action would denominate them both, which we ſee it doth not. When a ſtone fals downward, a plant growes, a beaſt goes, eats, ſleeps, we do not (nor can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly) ſay that God fals, growes, goes, eats, ſleeps. For although all theſe acts are in and from his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, yet, as they only are in the creature, as their ſubject, ſo they are alſo from the creatures na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural principles, from which there is a procedure of theſe acts different formally from that of the divine cooperation, for which they peculiar denominate

                     <p>Hence it may appear (which is the reaſon I have travailed ſo far in theſe School intricacies) how in the ſinful acts of man, the uſual diſtinction betwixt the action and the moral obliquity of it, and that the former is from God, the latter is mans only, may hold. For,</p>

                     <p n="2">2.

                     <p>IF it be here asked, How this may be, that God may uſe, and be the author of thoſe actions, or motions of his creature in ſubordination to his working providence, which in their formal and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral habitude are evill, and ſo deordinate or repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to his word, and yet his hand and providence be as clear from the ſin, as his word is clear againſt it: and how the creature is in this caſe juſtly puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhable by God?</p>
                     <p>I anſwer briefly:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. For the former, How God is clear from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the authour of the ſin?</p>

                        <pb n="58" facs="tcp:114672:53"/>1. It is not the ſin formally taken which God makes uſe of to the production of any natural effect, but the phyſical motion of the creature to which the ſin is adherent.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Let it be conſidered how man acteth in this phyſical ſubſerviency to God. He is not impelled by God, but he moveth of his own accord, and free choice; he is not moved (as I think it may be affirmed) phyſically of God, till he firſt move himſelf morally. Unto every moral act of man that is tranſient, and productive of any thing, there are required two things to be in him, Will and Power; the power, how great ſoever, doth nothing of it ſelf, it is the wils injuction that educeth the act; though both concur to the action or effect, yet the power doth not lead or draw forth the will, but the will actuates the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>. The power in it ſelf is neither good nor evill, <hi>poſſe peccare</hi> was no fault in <hi>Adam,</hi> he had it in his integrity; a defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility was both in him, and in the nature of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels originally: neither doth the power make the action to which it is exerted, either good or evill; but the moral tincture is wholly from the will, and ſo intirely doth it reſult thence, that the will in ſome ſort (whether to good or evill) ſtands for, or is equivalent to the deed in Gods account. The queſtion then is, Whence is the will moved to this or that ſinful act? God indeed uſeth the creatures hand or power, but who or what is the mover or ſwayer of the will? The <hi>Philoſopher</hi> ſaith, and it's true, God is <hi>primus motor,</hi> the firſt mover, but this he underſtands of phyſical motion, and therefore in the external execution of that deed which is ſinful, let it be granted that God begins, but in humane actions, there is a moral act which goes before the natural, an elicite act precedes the imperate, an election of the will before an elevation of the power. Now for the volition of the wil in reference to a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful work, that's of it ſelf, and its counſellor or dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, the practicall Intellect, as they may be each in their kind morally excited, or induced by their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:114672:53"/> attractives without, or the ſuggeſtions of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan; It muſt neceſſarily be acknowledged unto an evill courſe the will is not intrinſecally determined by God: he neither morally perſwades, nor phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally impels it to ſuch reſolution, purpoſe or choice. <hi>God tempteth not any man,</hi> &amp;c. [<hi>Jam.</hi> 1.13.] all, I think, that can be ſaid of God, as to that act of the will, is that he abandons, or leaves the man to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and to his objective and injective temptations, which though it may be an antecedent, yet is not in the leaſt a poſitive cauſe of the wills default; and yet he never doth that, but very righteouſly, both in regard of his diſobligation from any debt of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance to his creature, and in regard of juſt provocation from him, ever ſince his firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. There are cauſes imaginable wherein even one man may honeſtly joyne in the ſame act with another, when it is to his knowledge in that other a ſinful action: the diverſity of the principle and end making the concurrence of the one juſt, of the other wicked. Take for inſtance <hi>Reubens</hi> counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and acting with his brethren in the caſting of his brother <hi>Joſeph</hi> into the pit, which they did for a miſchief, he for a deliverance to him, [<hi>Gen.</hi> 37 21.] and <hi>Huſhaies</hi> counſel to <hi>Abſalom</hi> (which <hi>Abſalom</hi> and his companions embraced) in ſhew for <hi>Abſaloms</hi> ſervice againſt <hi>David,</hi> but in intention and real tendency quite contrary [2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.11, &amp;c.] And this is ſeen in the guiltleſs concurrence of one that is neceſſitated to enter into any contract that is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the party voluntarily contracting, whether uſury, or other<note n="*" place="margin">Vide <hi>Groti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> de Jure Belli lib. <hi>2.</hi> cap. <hi>26.</hi> Sect. <hi>5.</hi> &amp; lib. <hi>3.</hi> cap. <hi>1.</hi> Sect. <hi>22.</hi>

                     <p n="4">4. Let it be added, when God uſeth mans effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency to inflict that upon one which from the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate agent is ſinfully inferred, as ſuppoſe ſlaughter, robbery, defamation, or the like, there what is wickedly done by man, is alwayes juſtly from God upon the patient: he no leſſe righteouſly (as to the ſufferer) takes away a mans life by the hand of an aſſaſſinate, then if he did it by a diſeaſe, or any other means: and being ſo, if we think it no impeachment to the juſtice of a ſupreme magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to take away the life of a capital offender by ſuch a judge, or executioner as may act corruptly in it, as doing it with a minde meerly acted by cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, or mercenary reſpects; much more may we abſolve the providence of the Almighty in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of a ſinful inſtrument to the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his moſt juſt purpoſe and act.</p>

                     <p>IT is not to be doubted or denyed that Providence hath a voice, and doth declare ſomething of God to us. As God hath a working word, [Pſal. 33.6. &amp; 147.18. Luke 7.7.] ſo he hath a ſpeaking hand. Hence it is that his works are ſaid to be declarative and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, [<hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.1, &amp;c.] to be <hi>ſignes, [Jer.</hi> 32.20.] and men are willed <hi>to hear the rod, and who hath appointed it, [Mica.</hi> 6.9.] <hi>to come, and behold the works of the Lord, [Pſal.</hi> 46.8.] which would not be to any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe if they did not ſhew us ſomething remarkable of God. But the queſtion is, of what and how theſe are declarative to us? As it is a ſort of Atheiſm to deny Providence a voice, ſo it is a great preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and high impiety for man to take upon him to aſſign it its voice, or to make it ſpeak to his own mind and turn; and an error of very dangerous conſequence it is to miſunderſtand Providence, or conſtrue it in any other language then its author im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth and annexeth to it. For the diſcovery there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the truth in this particular, I ſhall endevor by the light of Scriptures (as well as I can apprehend them) to ſet down what Providence doth, and what it doth not diſcover.</p>

                     <p>In things which the conſcience is already infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of to be either agreeable, or repugnant to the law of God, providence coming in with any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, either croſſes or bleſſings, beareth witneſs to that law, and exciteth the conſcience by way of Memento to take ſpecial notice of it. And thus it is a good ſecond though not a ſolitary teſtimony. It hath <hi>vocem tonantem,</hi> an awakening, or ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling efficacy, to rouze up the dowzie conſolence to attend to the rule already received<note place="margin">

We cannot ſimply and ſingly conclude from any providence thus, God croſſeth men in this, bleſſeth them in that way, therefore he diſallows that; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves this. But having a precedent light in the conſcience from the teſtimony of Gods law of what he allowes and diſallowes, his ſo croſſing or bleſſing may be an accumulative witneſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>. Thus <hi>David</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, <hi>By this I know thou favoreſt me, becauſe mine enemy doth not triumph over me, [Pſal.</hi> 41.11.] He know before from the written word, and from the particular meſſages that he had received by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets <hi>Samuel</hi> and <hi>Gad</hi> both what God had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, and what he willed him to do; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon this mentioned Providence of God toward him was an additional teſtimony. And thus <hi>Joſephs</hi> brethen metting with a ſhrewd and ſudden croſſe were prompted out of the light, and ſentences of their own conſciences cleared, and called forth by
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:114672:60"/> that croſſe Providence (as they took it) in <hi>Egypt</hi> to ſay, <hi>we are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we ſaw the anguiſh of his ſoul, when he beſought us, and we would not hear: therefore is this diſtreſſe come upon us.</hi> And <hi>Reuben</hi> ſureably was enabled to ſay, <hi>Spake I not unto you ſaying, Do not ſin againſt the childe, and ye would not hear? therefore, behold alſo, his bloud is required, [Gen.</hi> 42.21, 22.]</p>
                     <p>And the reaſon of the neceſſity of the anteceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the knowledge of the will of God unto the voice of Providence is very obvious. For before we can gather, or draw inferences from Providences, we muſt be able to underſtand their meaning, and to make an interpretation of them. We muſt firſt know for what they come, ere we can ſay what they direct us unto; but now the word of God, and the conſcience in formed thereby, are the interpreters of Providence. It was that ſentence of the Apoſtles Epiſtle, which expounded the hand of God upon the <hi>Corinthians</hi> unto them, <hi>For this cauſe many are weak and ſickly among you, and many ſleep,</hi> [1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.30.] their own ſenſe could tell them of the event that many were weak and ſickly, and many dyed among them. And their Religion and conſcience touched by it would tell them theſe evils were of God, and perhaps it might ſuggeſt to them that they came for ſin; but that they might diſcern it was for that ſin in particular; <hi>viz.</hi> their eating and drinking unworthily at the Lords-table, and conſequently infer, that for this ſin they muſt judge themſelves, this they muſt reform, the word of God muſt be the expoſiter of that providence; and therefore did the Apoſtle write that ſaying to them.</p>
                     <p>Having inſiſted here on the extent of the uſe of Providence in dictating to man his duty by way of ſecondary teſtimony to the word; and of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of a conjuction of the word, or law of God written, or otherwiſe made known with Providence, that ſo the voice of Providence in moral, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and poſitive duties may be particularly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed and underſtood: It will not be impertinent
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:114672:61"/> here to note the different wayes wherein Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is, or hath been added to the word as confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive thereof.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. This hath been ſometimes in a way extrordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, and that,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Either when an ordinary act of Providence hath been by an extraordinary and immediate di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from God appointed to ſuch uſe, <hi>viz.</hi> to back and ſecond his word: as <hi>Ezekiels</hi> removing his goods out of his houſe to another place in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſight, was a ſign to them to confirm his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of their captivity. And the <hi>Potters</hi> diſpoſal of his clay to one mould firſt, then to another, was an emblem ſet up by God of his power to order, and alter the conditions of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> (and of all other Nations) as he ſhould ſee good, and as he had declared he would do concerning that people, [<hi>Ezek.</hi> 12.11. <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.5, 6, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>]</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Or when a Providence extraordinary, or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous, for nature hath been by expreſſe aſſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God given unto the ratification of his word. So was unto <hi>Moſes</hi> the turning of his <hi>rod</hi> into a <hi>ſerpent,</hi> and of the <hi>Serpent</hi> into a <hi>rod</hi> again, and his hand being made leprous, and whole again by putting it once and again into his boſom. So was unto <hi>Gideon</hi> his wet and dry Fleece, and the Angels conſuming his meat by fire out of the rock. So was unto <hi>Hezekiah</hi> the return back of the ſhadow of the Sun upon the Dial of <hi>Ahaz.</hi> And ſo were unto the world in the primitive age of Chriſtianity, the miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghoſt given unto the Apoſtles, [<hi>Exod.</hi> 4.1, &amp;c. <hi>Judg.</hi> 6.17, 36, &amp;c. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 20.10, &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.4.]</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This is more often in a way of ordinary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, that is without any either miraculouſneſs of the act of Providence, or immediate, particular pointing out of it, by an expreſs word to ſuch or ſuch a uſe. And this is,</p>

                     <p>But this diſtinction muſt be kept; for ſome acts of Providence are ſhewed us to imitate them in their very kinde.

The former he hath taken up to illuſtrate or enforce ſome commandement of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary nature, or ſome doctrine or propheſie
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:114672:62"/> new, and ſtrange to them to whom the ſign is given, and therefore ſtanding more in need thereof to prove its divine authority.</p>
                     <p>In reference alſo to the ſecondarineſs of the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Providence and the neceſſity of the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency of the words light to it in the matters whereof this propoſition ſpeaketh, this let me add.

                     <p n="5">5. And laſtly, there is yet another uſe of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to be noted. We before diſtinguiſhed betwixt the delivery of a rule or law, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining of it to this or that particular. We have ſaid before, Providence is not originally inſtitutive, or preceptive, yet it may deliver us the law, or the will of God already enacted by way of declaration, index, or remembrance; and this in ſome things ſolitarily, and in ſome only joyntly and concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently with other means. Beſides all this, Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence hath another uſe in promoting our knowledge and obedience to the will of God; and that is by way of application or determination of the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, or authority of the Law of God unto par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars. And this uſe of Providence, together with the way and divers manners of its tending there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto will here require a diſtinct diſcovery, that it may neither lie under a confuſed notion, nor fall under miſtake.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That Providence hath this uſe, to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine general rules to particulars, is very obvious and evident. It brings home the law, which in it ſelf runs in terms univerſal, or indefinite, to its ſingular matter, by applying it to particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, things and times; and by that means that commandement or direction which is delivered ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally to all of the like caſe and condition, it gives oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion or call to this or that man in particular to put in practice. For inſtance; the law of God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, <hi>ſuum cui<expan>

                           </expan> tribuere,</hi> to do right to every man; now Providence comes with its diſpoſing hand, and diſtributeth to every man his right in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, as this houſe, or field, this honour, dignity
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:114672:64"/> or authority to this or that man. And by this hand of Providence ſo diſpoſing is determined that general rule to theſe particulars; whereby it comes to paſſe that every other man is required to yeeld theſe perquiſites, or havings to this or that man, and is forbidden to take, or detain them from him. Again; the word of God ſaith, <hi>Is any among you afflicted? Let him pray. Is any merry? Let him ſing Pſalmes. As we have opportunity, let us do good.</hi> Now Providence comes in, and at this time diſpoſeth this condition of ſadneſs, or that of joy to me, or it putteth into my hand an opportunity of almes-giving, and thereby it comes about that it is, now my part to perform that duty of Prayer, Singing, or giving almes. The word of God hath inſtituted diverſities of eſtates and relations amongſt men, as marriage and ſingle life; Magiſtracy, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection; Maſterſhip, and ſervitude: not impoſing every one, or any one of theſe c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nditions upon every man, for that were not conſiſtible; but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing one for ſome, another for other perſons. Now beſides this inſtitution, God by his Providence immediately (without his word, otherwiſe then mediately) ordinarily cals men forth parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, ſome unto this, others to that eſtate: and thoſe particular perſons, whom his Providence ſo cals, the general rules of his word concerning thoſe reſpective conditions come thus to be in force unto, requiring them to undertake thoſe conditions, and to perform the ſeveral duties annexed to them reſpectively. Here then by the intervention of Providence it is that the general rules concerning this or that ſpecial ſtate or relation, either the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance upon it, or the diſcharge of the duties of it, become neceſſary to this, or that man. <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, under this uſe I ſhall call Ordinative, in diſtinction from that which is meerly Eventual.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, as it is plain that Providence hath this uſe, ſo it will be requiſite to enquire how Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence cals men into this or that ſtate or relation, and ſo effects this determination of general rules to

For the different acceptions, or ſenſes wherein God may be ſaid to call men into ſuch a relation or ſtate we ſay by his Providence God calls to the ſame, either <hi>directive,</hi> or <hi>conſtitutive.</hi> Either by directing them to ſuch an eſtate, or by conſtituting them in it; that is, either by ſetting before them the eſtate as requiſite for them to enter into: or, by leading and putting them actually into it. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is when thoſe occaſions and inducements, or exigencies are occurrent to a man which (when they are put, or in being) it is his duty according to the rule of Gods word to enter into ſuch a ſtate, or relation. The latter is when by the acting of Providence by thoſe means whereby ſuch a ſtate or relation is produced, or emergent, men are actually brought and placed in that eſtate.</p>
                     <p>Theſe two wayes are manifeſtly different, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be diſtinguiſhed. For inſtance; In the former ſenſe perſons are called to the ſtate of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage when they have not the <hi>gift of continency,</hi> that is, it is their duty then to marry, according to that [1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.9, 36.] and he is called to a ſingle life thus that hath that <hi>power over his own will</hi> that is mentioned [1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.37. <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.11.] according to that of our Saviour [<hi>Mat.</hi> 19.12.] In the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſenſe, they are called to a marryed eſtate that are already bound, or entred into wedlock. He is called into the ſingle eſtate that is looſed, [1 Cor. 7.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>4, 27.] And in like manner may it be ſaid of domeſtical Maſterſhip and ſervitude; and of political domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and ſubjection; and of domeſtical and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical freedom. It is one thing to ſay a man is by Providence called to be a Maſter, or a Servant; a Prince, or a Subject the former way; that is, he hath the previous inducements to any ſuch eſtate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:114672:65"/> to him; and another thing to ſay he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the latter way, <hi>viz.</hi> that thoſe acts are paſſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or by him which make him a Maſter, or a Maſter or a Servant, a Magiſtrate, or a Subject. By the former he is but invited or directed to ſuch a ſtate, by the latter he is inveſted or enſtated <hi>de facto</hi> in it.</p>
                     <p>This diſtinction is obſervable in them that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute to the validity of abſolute conqueſt, or cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity to make a man a domeſtick ſervant, or a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, the patrimonial kingdom of the conquerer.

                        </note>. As in like manner it is in the caſe of a ſingle perſon that hath not the gift of continency, he is called to marriage, but is unmarried, and hath the power, and right to diſpoſe of himſelf, yet in regard he wanteth the ſaid gift he is obliged to marry as ſoon as a fit match is offered.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, concerning the means by which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence may call one into any ſtate that is, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt, and enſtate him in it; for this conſideration will have relation to the latter acception only of the providential call, of which even now, <hi>viz.</hi> that which is conſtitutive or actually ſetting a man in a ſtate.</p>
                     <p>Providence is working in all morall affaires, and civill ſtations, and conducing to the bringing of men into the ſeveral relations they are in, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

Some relative ſtates are ſuch as providence cals, that is, brings perſons into them, by means ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecal,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:114672:65"/> as to the perſons called, or without the act of their own wils. So perſons come into the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and obligation of children to their Parents by procreation, ſay ſome; by preſervation and education, ſay others<note n="*" place="margin">

So are others, through the defect of reaſon, as Orphans, Fools, and Madmen brought into the condition of pupils and minors in relation to Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians and Tutors; and ſo are Delinquents or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors through their vicious miſcarriages, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their wils, reduced into ſubjection or ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very<note n="†" place="margin">

                        </note>. 2. Other relative ſtates Divine Providence leads men into with, and by the will, choice, or conſent of the parties in whom the relation is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected. Thus by their own contract perſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come aſſociates in private Traffique, fellow-citizens are incorporate in one Common-wealth, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions become confederates in one league: thus two by marriage become man and wife, and perſons by arrogation or adoption become the children of thoſe who begat them not. Thus freemen make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſervants; and thus Common-wealths, or bodies politique come under this or that form or conſtitu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Thirdly, For the manner how (we may ſay) Providence cals into any eſtate or relation.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, In general this is a principle to me moſt certain. A providential call is included within the rules of Gods word. We have already ſaid (and I take it as a clear truth) that in matters of this nature Providence by it ſelf or alone is neither legiſlative nor declarative of the law of God. It remains therefore that the utmoſt uſe and force it is of in the moral ſway of theſe affairs is either to ſecond and ſet home the rule already given, and made known, or to apply and determine the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral obligation and authority of ſuch a rule to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars. Hence we muſt needs yield that the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Providence to this of that act, eſtate or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, as it is not from it ſelf, but by virtue of the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:114672:66"/> rule ſo it keeps within the bounds, and confines of the rule, and cannot be conſtrued to go any further. This then may be for a general Canon to us. We cannot ſay Providence cals this, or that man to that, whether act or eſtate, which the word of God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids or warrants not unto him. Providence muſt not be uſed as a countermand to the rule, or as a reſerve or dormant warrant to carry us out farther then the word goes before us, or to lead us there where the will of God in Scripture revealed opens us not a way. This were by conſequent to deſtroy the authority of the word, and to make the moſt pure and perfect wayes of God the occaſions and patroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers of every obliquity.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, for ſomewhat more particular reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on concerning a providential call to any underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, let theſe (I ſuppoſe plain) Propoſitions and Cautions be conſidered, the which I lay down with room reſerved for, and ſubmiſſion to the neceſſary addition, and juſt correction of the Reader.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The matters, or things about which this uſe of Providence (of applying, or determining the general rule to its particulars) may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant, we may (I ſuppoſe) reduce to theſe heads.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. Either opportunities inviting.</item>

                     </list>
                     <p n="1">1. The former, opportunities inviting, may be,
<list>
                           <item>1. Either to our attaining.</item>
                           <item>2. Or to our doing good. Or, either to a good of utility to be enjoyed; or to a good of virtue to be done by us.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. The latter, neceſſities urging, may be,
<list>
                           <item>1. Either danger of ſinning.</item>
                           <item>2. Or danger of ſuffering.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Every opportunity inviting to, or offering us the attainment of ſomewhat we eſteem good, is not taken to be a determining Providence, or a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence calling to the proſecution, and laying hold on that offer. Providence doth ordinarily preſent
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:114672:66"/> us with opportunities to be ſhunned, as well as with opportunities to be embraced. And by its orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring reall evils, with the appearance of good caſt upon them by our own miſtaken judgments, are ſet before us, as well as the things that are truly good. There is a proving trying as well as a gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Providence, [ſee <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

Many Providences which our heady paſſions and luſts are apt to account invitatory, our reaſon and religion ſhould prompt us to be but exploratory, or the trials of our obedience to Gods commandements. Such (for example) may we reckon that opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to be which <hi>David</hi> had ſet before him (and whilh his men would ſo fain have had him to have taken as eminently held out to him by God) of killing <hi>Saul,</hi> once in the cave,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.3. &amp; 26.7.</note> and again in the Camp aſleep. The call therefore of Gods Providence muſt be gathered, not by the facility, commodiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or rarity of the opportunity, but by the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Opportunities of doing what is in it ſelf good, whether permiſſively good, that is, lawfull, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptively good, that is, neceſſary, are not preſently of themſelves the call of Providence to us, nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till it can be determined the good to be done is good to us, or the good we are to do.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Thence, and in as much as the goodneſs of an action with application to individuals ariſeth much from the particular ſtate and condition of the perſon. Somethings belonging to the rich, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things to the poor; ſome to the marryed, ſome to the ſingle; ſome to the ſuperiour, ſome to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour; to be done by them reſpectively, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nooyeth each to know firſt, not only what is permitted, or impoſed on this or that eſtate, but what is the proper eſtate, place, or rela<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="5">5. Unto every eſtate there muſt needs be (the nature of the thing is ſelf requires it) ſomething conſtitutive or eſſential to the putting of it, or the enſtating of a man in it. There cannot be order or a diſtinction of eſtates without ſomewhat to make the difference. The ſame authority that ordains different eſtates among men, appoints to each the peculiar way of entring into, or founding thoſe eſtates. The different acts which are proper to each eſtate cannot be conſtituting or differencing cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of them: both becauſe they are ſubſequent to, and reſulting from the eſtate, and therefore muſt needs ſuppoſe it in being ere they can flow from it: and becauſe others not called to theſe eſtates do ſometimes preſume to put forth thoſe acts: and becauſe the regularity of thoſe acts muſt be proved by the perſons being in the eſtate; and therefore his being in the eſtate cannot be proved by his doing of thoſe acts. That there is ſuch a peculiar foundation or ingreſſe to every relative ſtate, which gives it bring, and diſtinguiſheth it from other ſtates, hath been partly ſhewed before, and will be inſiſted on after. In all domeſtical, civil, martial, and eccleſiaſtical relations and orders, the profeſſors of the diſciplines of each conclude it ſo to be. Now this conſtitutive or formal reaſon applyed to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars will ſerve to diſcover in what ſtation, or place each man ſtands, and unto what relation or ſtate any man is called of God.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Where the divine rule or law of God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed a ſpecial way of entring into any eſtate, and conſtituting one in it, there providence cannot be underſtood to call, or lead into it another way, or in a courſe croſſe or ſubverſive to that order.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Providence may call a man without the act or concurrence of his own wil into this or that eſtate, that is, make it his duty (by virtue of the divine rule) to enter into it (as he is thereby called to be a ſervant, who hath not either wealth or skill whereby
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:114672:67"/> to ſubſiſt in, and manage a free eſtate. He is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to marry whoſe temperament, or complexion leaves him not that power over himſelf as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain) when nevertheleſſe it doth not without his own will conſtitute him in that eſtate. Where there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the being of a man in any eſtate, or relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is prerequired the act or aſſent of the party, there Providence (though it invite, order, or give occaſion to enter into that eſtate) doth not anticipate the perſons conſent.

It is (I conceive) no otherwiſe in the ſubject matter of this Treatiſe, in civil policie and Magiſtracy. Providence by virtue of that need many wayes that particular emergencies of Providence may invite, lead, or call a Nation to make choice of this form of Magiſtracy before another, or of this, or theſe perſons to rule over them rather then others: but, nevertheleſſe, people are not incorporate into diſtinct ſocieties, nor ſocieties re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into a moral relation, or ſubjection unto any particular Magiſtracy, or Magiſtrates without their own tranſaction or agreement, their own I mean tranſacted, either by themſelves or thoſe whom they may be involved in.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Where Providence preſents with any urging neceſſity, whether of ſin or of harm to be avoided, there we muſt not think Providence to call, either for the ſhunning of a harm to commit a ſin, or for the avoiding of one ſin to run into another.

                     <p>I have thus endevoured to take a particular view of that guidance, light, or inſtruction that is in Providence, and how far it goes, what of God, and of his will it doth diſcover to us, and what it doth not. The ſum of all that I have gone over is, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence is the image, or index of Gods decree, or counſel, that is, as to things that are, or have been, not concerning future things. It makes known that God is, and what he is, and that he is to be honored, ſerved, and in all he commands obeyed.

                     <p>IN oppoſition to the negative part of this reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Queſtion about the uſe of Providence there are two poſitions, or opinions now on foot, both which would make out a wider, or larger ſenſe, or uſe of Providence then is here allowed. They are, 1. That Providence of it ſelf may (without extraordinary appointment) in the matters above ſpecified, and ſpecially in humane rights, dues, or tranſactions, deliver and declare what the will of God is, or may juſtifie or condemn a way: or, where Scripture evidence is wanting, or a warrant out of the word of God cannot be produced, there we may collect or infer Gods approval, or diſapprovall of an humane action, courſe or proceeding by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. 2. That dominion is, or may be founded meerly in eventual Providence; or, that a perſon or perſons attainment, and occupiation (by whatever means) of ſway or command over a people makes him, or them the Sovereign or <hi>higher power,</hi>
                        <pb n="90" facs="tcp:114672:69"/> which is, <hi>of God, the ordinance of God, the miniſter of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the latter, that Dominion is, or may be founded in eventual Providence, or, (which is all one) in a perſons being in place of rule or actual command, the confutation of it, and the vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this Text from admitting it, is a main drift and ſubject of this whole diſcourſe: and therefore I refer the Reader, for his ſatisfaction about it, to that which is before, and will be after ſaid; only this I ſhall put in, upon its mention here.</p>
                     <p>If this be ſo, It muſt needs be affirmed (I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) ſo to be,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Either becauſe poſſeſſion, or occupation in every caſe, or in any thing poſſeſſible, or in every ſort of Tenure gives a title; But this is ſo wilde an aſſertion, as I know not who will own it; or,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Becauſe God hath declared in his word, or made it a law, that it ſhall be ſo in this particular matter of Civill authority, <hi>viz.</hi> that whoſoever is maſter ſhall be the Magiſtrate, or he whom his hand of Providence raiſeth up to a domineering preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in any place ſhall have the authority there, or be intereſted in the ſtyle or office of this text, <hi>viz.</hi> ſhall be <hi>the higher power, the ordinance, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of God.</hi> But unto this;</p>
                     <p n="1">1. If ſo it were, it would be not Providences di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſing poſſeſſion of rule into this hand that of it ſelf conſtituteth him a power, but that declaration of God in his word. Providence would be only the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminator, or applyer of that general rule to its particular matter.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But where is this found, that God hath ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed or declared himſelf, or made ſuch a law touching. Civill Magiſtracy? We muſt firſt ſee ſuch a declaration produced, or proved, ere we may grant it ſo to be: I know this text is alledged as the only or main place to imply ſuch a declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but, <hi>de hoc quaritur:</hi> I hope by this treatiſe it
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:114672:69"/> will be manifeſt that there is not ſuch a thing to be extracted thence: and in ſhort, I think it will be proved that,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. By <hi>power,</hi> is not meant a meer force or ſtrong hand.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That by <hi>being</hi> is not meant a meer act of poſſeſſion of ſuch a force.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That by <hi>of God, ordained of God,</hi> is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended a meer being by eventual Providence. And to give the Reader here a ſmall earneſt of Reaſon for the improbability of their being either in this, or in any other Scripture any ſuch thing declared by God, I ſhall ſuggeſt theſe few things in this place.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The power of Magiſtracy may be in one, and actual rule by Providence in another. Gods word hath owned them for the power that have been out of poſſeſſion, whileſt others have had the actual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. Take for inſtance what is in [2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22.9, 12. with Chap. 23.3.]</p>
                     <p n="2">2. God hath expreſly diſowned for being of him them that have been in preſent poſſeſſion of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, [<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 8.4. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52.4, 5. <hi>Joel</hi> 3.2, 4. <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.5, 6.]</p>
                     <p n="3">3.

                     <p n="4">4. We have many examples (of unqueſtionable juſtifiableneſſe) in the word of God of perſons taking up and employing for the recovery of perſons, goods and countreyes of the hands of them that have had the Maſtery and poſſeſſion of them, which could not be done if dominion were found by God in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential profeſſion, [<hi>Gen.</hi> 14.14, &amp;c. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.1, &amp;c. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Subſection 7.</hi> That Providence alone, or without the Rule of Gods word doth not ſignifie to us the allowing, or diſallowing will of God in matters either of humane right, or poſitive inſtitution.</head>

                     <p n="1">1. That which is in this poſition attributed to Providence is by Scripture plainly denyed to it [<hi>Eccl.</hi> 9.1, 2.] <hi>No man knoweth either love, or hatred by all that is before them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="2">2. The putting of any thing to be rule beyond, or further then Scripture goes, or ſo as to make out ſuch an approving, or diſapproving will, or law of God as is not delivered in Scripture, is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate from, or deny that ſufficiency and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Scripture which the holy Ghoſt aſcribeth
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:114672:70"/> thereto, and which we, upon his authority, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain againſt the Papiſts. The written word of God is affirmed to be perfect [2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.7.] we have very ſtrict prohibitions of adding to, or diminiſhing ought from it, [<hi>Deut.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.6. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.18, 19.] we finde men are ſharply blamed by God for doing that his word gave them no command or commiſſion for, [<hi>Jer.</hi> 7.31. &amp; 19.5. &amp; 32.35.] and perſons are challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for following the appearance or promiſing face of Providence without recourſe to him [<hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.1, 2. with 31.1. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 9.14] We upon theſe and the like au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities, conceive that the good, the acceptable and perfect will of God is contained in the Scriptures; that the word of God hath compleatly and unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly delivered what is neceſſary, what lawful; and therefore that it appears to be high preſumption and ſtrong deluſion to ſet up any thing to be a rule, either by way of croſſing, or uttering more then is read in Scripture. Either we muſt ſay the Scriptures are imperfect, or the doctrine therein is repealable by Providence; or that there is nothing left for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to declare anew. And which of theſe to admit, I think is eaſie to chooſe.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Providences are both in themſelves ſo indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct and various, and in relation to mens wayes, and the rule by which they are to walk, ſo unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable (for the moſt part in this life) and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionable, that it is not (I think) to any man conceiveable how they ſhould be employed for ſuch a ſignification.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. They are in themſelves ſo indiſtinct and various, in reſpect of riſe, end, and manner of proceeding, that they appear altogether unapt for ſuch a uſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Providence is many times the ſame to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and wayes directly contrary; that is, to them that are approved, and to them that are diſapproved of God, the courſe of Providence in preſent event is all one: the ſame judgements or evils do befall the ſame outward benefits to come upon righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:114672:71"/> and wicked perſons and wayes, [<hi>Ezek.</hi> 21 3. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.45.]</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The ſame ſame wayes or proceedings of men may meet with clear contrary Providences, either in the ſame perſon at divers times, or in divers perſons at the ſame time. He that followes a courſe of ſin, may at one time proſper, at another time fall in it. The path of the righteous may at ſometime be (as <hi>Joh</hi> ſpeaks) <hi>waſhed with butter,</hi> attended with ſmooth and ſweet ſucceſſes, and at other times be ſtuck with thornes, entangled with ſharpe and piercing croſſes: they that walke or joyn hand in hand together in the ſame wayes or deſignes whether good or evill may be accoſted with quite contrary events at the hands of Providence. Like as it fared with <hi>Pharaohs chief Butler, and chief Baker;</hi> both it may be guilty in the ſame offence, and meaſure, yet the one raiſed to honour, the other hanged on a tree.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The ſame kind of Providence may proceed from far different or quite contrary diſpoſitions, and intentions in God: the ſame gift, or outward, and, in our eſteem, happy ſucceſſe, and on the other hand, the ſame croſſe or blow may come from him unto divers perſons, to one in favour, to another in diſpleaſure; to one for good, to another for harme.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Providences contrary in their face, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible appearance, may agree, and be coincident, or be the ſame in reſpect of the minde of God from which they proceed. Notably good, and notably bad events, both theſe may ſpring from his love, and be accompanied with his approval both of the perſon and of the way upon which they come: and either of theſe may iſſue from his hatred, and be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with his diſlike both of the perſon and way.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The thing which Providence in bringing good, or evill may reſpect, reflect upon or aime at in ſpeciall may be, not the preſent actions or wayes of men, but either thoſe of times paſt, or thoſe which be probable, and in likelyhood to come: to
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:114672:71"/> the former by way of recompence; to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

And in both theſe conſiderations, and the ſeverall particulars reducible to either of them, it may appear how unſutable and inſignificant eventual Providence is to the diſcovery of the will of God in the matters aboveſaid, by it ſelf alone, or without a prediſcovery by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

There is this difference betwixt natural, or neceſſary and voluntary agents; that of the former the inward principle, appetite, and inſtinct is diſcovered by the act, or effect, becauſe the ſaid principles, and operations are alwayes uniform, and the ſame: but in rational agents, the faculty being free, and indeterminate, and in different to divers or contrary concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and motions, the outward act cannot na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, or neceſſarily with any certainty, or any otherwiſe then <hi>ad placitum,</hi> or by arbitrary impoſition and appointment ſignifie the meaning or dictate of ſuch a faculty.</p>

Of God)</hi> The ſeveral wayes wherein things may be ſaid to be <hi>of God,</hi> have been above diſtinguiſhed of, and explicated, and the matter of civill dominion hath been found among the things which eventuall Providence by it ſelf doth not declare: the Queſtion then is, concerning the being of a thing of Gods hand by way of efficiency, and the being of his mouth by way of warrant, or approvall, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>there both of theſe, or but one, and if but one, which of them is meant by that clauſe in this place.</p>
               <p>That the Apoſtle, when he ſaith, <hi>there is no power but of God,</hi> may intend to include within his meaning a providential being, or a being of the diſpoſing hand of God, I will not gainſay, but withall I think it muſt be affirmed, and granted, that ſuch a being of God is not the whole, or ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall meaning of his words; but that he hath ſome eye (if it be not his primary aime, which I rather
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:114672:73"/> think; and let the Reader judge when he hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed what ſhall be ſaid for it) unto a being of the mouth of God, approving, warranting and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing the power.</p>
               <p>Moreover, that being of his hand or Providence which may be here intended, I would underſtand, not after the common notion, <hi>viz.</hi> of meer even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Providence, or a perſons bare poſſeſſing, or get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting into the place of rule, and command by any means whatſoever; but I underſtand it of that courſe of Providence which is before ſpecified to be ordinative; or ſuch a diſpoſing hand of God as gives the perſon a call, or an allowing admiſſion to the place; or ſuch a Providence as doth apply and determine the general rule or Warrant of Gods word concerning civill Magiſtracy to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar caſe.</p>
               <p>This ordinative courſe of Providence, in diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from that which is meerly eventual, was in the general opened even now, and in reference to our preſent ſubject in particular, to wit, the Civil power, will be illuſtrated in the next Chapter; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which alſo, and ſome other following Chapters I ſhall reſerve the proof of this ſenſe that I here give of this clauſe, to wit, that it imports the being of the power of Gods mouth or word (not excluding the diſpoſur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of providence, but taking it in, being underſtood of ſuch a procedure of Providence as is conjoyned, and concurrent with the authorizing word of God, and is the execution, or effectuating thereof, and that a bare poſſeſſory act; or a perſons occupancy of the ſeat of power by a meer eventual Providence, is not the true and proper importance of the words.</p>
               <p>Only here, to give ſome light to the diſcerning of the difference betwixt thoſe two, and to ſhew a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the neceſſity of underſtanding the words as I have expreſſed, take a view of both in a Scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. It is the caſe as is ſtood betwixt thoſe two Brothers <hi>Solomon</hi> and <hi>Adonijah</hi> in relation to the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> The caſe may well be ſtated in
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:114672:73"/> the words of <hi>Adonijah</hi> himſelf unto <hi>Solomons</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as they are ſet down [1 <hi>King.</hi> 2.15.] <hi>thou knoweſt that the kingdom was mine, and that all Iſrael ſet their faces on me, that I ſhould reign: Howbeit the Kingdom is turned about, and become my Brothers, for it was his from the Lord.</hi> Here are two perſons repreſented as having been claimers and competitors of the ſame kingdom, at one and the ſame time. Now let me ask, in as much as both could not be, which of theſe two muſt we ſay was the power which was <hi>of God,</hi> in the ſenſe of our Text? The one <hi>Adonijah,</hi> he hath to alledge for himſelf a being in it by eventual Providence: <hi>All Iſrael ſet their faces on me that I ſhould reign.</hi> This was as much as if he had ſaid, he was gotten into the throne, and had full admiſſion and poſſeſſion by the people. And ſo by the ſtory it appears he had [ſee 1 <hi>King.</hi> 1.5, 7, 9, 11, 18, 25.] and upon this ground he built to himſelf a Title; <hi>The Kingdom was mine,</hi> ſaith he. On the other hand there was for <hi>Solomon</hi> the Lords deſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of him by word of mouth to <hi>David</hi> before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand [1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.5, 6, 7. &amp; 22.9, 10.] and an ordinative Providence of God diſpoſing <hi>David</hi> firſt to promiſe and to ſwear to <hi>Bathſheba</hi> his Mother, and after to decree and give out command to <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dok, Nathan,</hi> and <hi>Benaiah</hi> to anoint him King; though even then <hi>Adonijah</hi> ſtood ſeiſed of the Kingdom, [1 <hi>King.</hi> 1.17, 32, &amp;c.] and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Adonijah</hi> himſelf having ſurceaſed and become a private perſon again, upon this ground acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth that <hi>Solomon</hi> had the better of him in point of title, for <hi>it was his from the Lord.</hi> Of theſe two different pleas, if we lake the eventuall Providence by which <hi>Adonijah</hi> was poſſeſſed of the Kingdom to bear the ſenſe of this Text, of a <hi>being of God,</hi> by virtue whereof every ſoul is to be ſubject to the perſon ſo being; then muſt we lay aſide <hi>Solomon</hi> from being <hi>the power of God;</hi> and the enterpriſe of <hi>David, Bathſheba, Nathan,</hi> and the reſt of ſeating him in the throne, muſt be diſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:114672:74"/> as contrary to the rule of this Text, and ſettle <hi>Adonijah</hi> when he was in: but this were to null and diſallow the expreſſe direction and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of God, appointing the Kingdom to <hi>Solomon,</hi> and the lawfull proceeding upon it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cited out of the ſtory. On the other hand if we take that warrant of Gods word unto <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> ſeconded by that his ordinative Providence which moved the perſons above mentioned, who in that caſe were intereſted, to advance <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> to the Crown, to anſwer this phraſe in our text <hi>of the powers being of God,</hi> then muſt we ſay that a meer eventual Providence is not the right, and proper importance of the words.</p>
               <p>But this ſhall be more at large diſcuſſed in the next Chapter, wherein I ſhall proceed to the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the next phraſe in the Text, <hi>viz. Ordained of God.</hi>

To them that are converſant in Scripture, and other books of Divinity, it is at firſt ſight evident that there is a ſenſe wherein all things that be, or fall out in the world, even the ſins of men, are ſaid to be
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:114672:75"/> ordered or diſpoſed by God: and there is a ſenſe whereby it is peculiar to ſome things to be diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed or ordered by him. If we here take the word in the former ſenſe, there is nothing peculiar, no more ſpoken of, or for the powers here argued and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for, then is univerſally extenſible to every other matter, and in ſpecial to all humane occurrences, or affaires, be they in themſelves never ſo inordinate and irregular.

Wherefore to me it ſeems neceſſary that we think of a more reſtrained ſenſe of this word, and diſcern what that is, and for this purpoſe thus to diſtinguiſh of it.</p>
                  <p>There is a twofold order, ordination or diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to be aſcribed unto God, as ſet down by him.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The order of his counſel, and working, or of his purpoſe, and proceeding in Providence.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The order of his word or law, or the order which he inſtituteth for his creature, particularly for man.</p>
                  <p>Of the former, the order of his own counſel, way, and working we read, [<hi>Act.</hi> 13.48. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.91. &amp; 8.2. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.35, 36. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.33.]</p>
                  <p>Of the latter, the order of his word, revealed will, or law given to man [1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.14. &amp; 14.30. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.11. <hi>Pſal.</hi>

                     </gap>1.5.]</p>
                  <p>Of the former we may again diſtinguiſh. By the order of his purpoſe, and providence God or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Things either effectively or operatively; when by his working will and concourſe he poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively and immediately acteth to or in upon them; thus he ordereth all poſitive effects in their natural beings.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Or privatively, or by way of permiſſion, or non <hi>impedition,</hi> and ſo he is ſaid to order, that is
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:114672:76"/> decree and diſpoſe the being of ſin, in that he leaves his reaſonable creature to himſelf, under an objective temptation.</p>
                  <p>And the former of theſe two, his effective, opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ordination is again diſtinguiſhable. He effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually orders things,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Either productively, or to the cauſing of a thing to be.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Or directively, that is, by preſcribing to the thing that already is, or diſpoſing of its ſtate and courſe. And thus he is ſaid even to order ſin, to wit, in its progreſs and conſequents; for although as to the being of ſin, his ordination be only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive, or non-impeditive, yet as to its progreſs, end, and conſequents his Providence is effective<note n="*" place="margin">Aliud eſt faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eus, aliud fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum, aliud u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum<expan>

                  <p>Theſe two, the order of Gods counſel and hand of Providence, and the order of his word, law, or inſtitution given to man, are manifeſtly different, and in reference to the preſent ſubject neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be diſtinguiſht. The difference may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken thus:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The former order is the rule, model, or platform of Gods own wayes, the latter is to be the rule and patern of mans doings.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The former extends to all creatures and beings; the latter only to the reaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and his moral acts, as being only capable of a law.</p>

                     <hi>SECT. II.</hi> What the ſpecial and proper acception of the term <hi>Ordained of God,</hi> is in this text.</head>
                  <p>HAving thus expreſſed the importance in general, and diſtinguiſhed the ſeveral acceptions of this clauſe, <hi>ordained of God;</hi> our next work is to diſcern poſitively and particularly the purpoſe of it in this text. There being this variety in the uſe of it in divers places of Scripture, as it's brought in on di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers occaſions; the queſtion is, how we are here to take it.</p>
                  <p>For this, my reſolution is, that in this ſentence of the Apoſtle, <hi>ordained of God,</hi> importeth not meerly the proceeding of the things from God providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, as Providence is put to ſignifie Gods coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and acting, but ſuch a being from God as car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryeth in it his inſtituting or appointing of it by the warrant, or ſanction of his word, law, precept, or commandment. Although it be true, and may be ſaid, that the riſe, the ſtanding, and the falling of every civill power is, as all other occurrences in the world whatſoever, are ordered and diſpoſed by the counſell of Gods will, and the hand of his acting.
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:114672:78"/> Yet I conceive this not to be the thing which the Apoſtle here only, or ſpecially (if at all) takes in, or intends; but the main thing within his porpoſe, and aime to be the aſſerting of Gods preceptive ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Civil Magiſtracy. My aſſertion then is, that this Propoſition, <hi>The Powers that be are ordained of God,</hi> is a poſitive declaration of the divine right, property, or title which thoſe powers which are meant in, and are the ſubject of this text, have to their place of dignity, and rule, and to the obedience of every ſoul within the Civil ſtate by virtue of the Law, revealed will, or warrant of God delivered in his word, or otherwiſe promulgated. And this I aſſert in oppoſition to that claim or title which ſome would build upon this text for ſuch as obtain the upper hand, or a prevalent poſſeſſion, by virtue of a meer eventual Providence, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this term <hi>ordained,</hi> of ſuch a being of God.</p>
                  <p>They that would found the power upon meer eventual Providence, by virtue of theſe words, do not well agree what it is that they would build upon them. Some of them underſtanding the words to give a title, property or right to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or perſons that hold poſſeſſion of the place of rule, in as much as they are in by Providence. Others admit the meer occupant to be an unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted, unlawful, unjuſt Ruler, but they ſay, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in place by the order, or ordination of divine Providence, he is therefore a Power to be obeyed. But my aſſertion ſtands againſt both theſe, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming this ordination of God not meerly to import a providential poſſeſſion, but withall, and eſpecially a preceptive inſtitution or legiſlative ſanction. Which if it hold and be made good, will infer, that meer eventual Providence doth not by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of this text, either create a title, or command obedience to an unentitled power. The Power which this text intends it doth juſtifie, or imply neceſſarily to be a lawful, enrighted, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled power: but then it bottometh this right
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:114672:78"/> and title, not upon eventual Providence,<note place="margin">CHAP. V. SECT. III.</note> or a meer poſſeſſory act, but upon the warrant of the word, or law of God, here called his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. The nature of the Power here ſpoken of, argues this to be the ſenſe of the words, <hi>ordained of God.</hi> The Power here is not a meer natural or phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, but (as was before ſhewed) a Moral power. Now the text undertaking to deſcribe to us the procedure, or origination of this power, or to tell us whence it is, <hi>viz. of God,</hi> and how of him, <hi>viz.</hi> by way of <hi>ordination;</hi> it muſt intend ſuch an <hi>ordination</hi> of God as is agreeable to the nature of the power, or ſutable to produce ſuch a power. But natural power is one way from God, Morall power another. Natural power is from the hand of his providence, his efficiency or active concourſe: Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral power is from the mouth of God, from his mouth commanding or authorizing the thing. We aſcribe unto God, as two diſtinct faculties, or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, dominion, and ſtrength; authority, and a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency; right to rule, and ability or mightineſſe to act and inforce; a willing or legiſlative, and working power<note n="*" place="margin">See above Chap. <hi>1.</hi> Sect. <hi>3.</hi> And <hi>Zanch.</hi> de Nat. Dei lib. <hi>4.</hi> cap. <hi>8.</hi> qu. <hi>3.</hi> pag. <hi>424.</hi>
                     </note>. And ſutably to theſe two faculties we may attribute to him a twofold act, <hi>viz.</hi> a Moral, and a Phyſical act; a morall act proceeding from his ſupreme dominion, authority, or right to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; and a Phyſical act iſſuing from his Almightineſs, or infinite potency. The former is
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:114672:79"/> the act of his mouth; the latter the act of his hand. And accordingly from theſe two diſtinct faculties, and their reſpective acts in God there is communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the creature a double power: a Moral power, that is a derivative right, or warrant, or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to have, or to do this or that; and this comes from the ſaid Moral act of God: a Natural, or Phyſical power, a force, ability, or prevalency to this or that operation, derived from that Phyſical act of God. Now then, when it is ſaid here, the powers are <hi>from God, ordained of God,</hi> theſe powers being moral, the meaning muſt be they are of Gods mouth, ordained by his precept or word, calling, and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizing them to their dignities, and functions. The truth is, nothing hath any obligation or morality, but by virtue of the law of a Superior; a meer Phyſical act of it ſelf cannot introduce a moral obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation; as Mr <hi>Selden,</hi> and others have well mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, unto whom I refer my Reader<note n="*" place="margin">

                  <p n="3">3. I argue from the ſubjection which is in this verſe commanded to be paid unto the powers here ſpoken of, to perſwade whereunto is the Apoſtles ſcope in theſe words, and for the urging on of the ſame, this is his firſt and principal rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>The powers to be ſubjected to, are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained of God.</hi> Now let be conſidered what the nature of this ſubjection is in the intent of the Apoſtle, and it will help well to lead us to his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in theſe words, <hi>ordained of God.</hi> The ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on injoyned is not a paſſive ſuccumbency, or patient ſubmiſſiveneſs under the thing to be ſubjected un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, as under a burden or croſſe; but it is a free, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, voluntary and active ſubmiſſion, or ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; the former hath an eye directly unto a thing as being by Providence or the hand of God; and were that the ſenſe of the ſubjection here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of Chriſtians, it would be ſutable and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to underſtand this ordination of God of a meer providential being of him. But evident it is, that the precept, <hi>Let every ſoul be ſubject to the higher Powers,</hi> bears the latter conſtruction, to wit, of a
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:114672:80"/> voluntary and active ſubordination. The verbe <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> ſo ſignifies. Divines obſerve upon the word, it imports a ſubjection according to order, and ſuch a ſubjection as is that of perſons, that ſtand in a relative inferiority to their ſuperiours, as wives, children, ſervants, and ſubjects to their reſpective correlatives; who are not only to bear them that are over them, but to be ſubordinate to them with good will, and in many duties and offices to act un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and ſerve them. They note alſo the word is of the middle voice, and therefore ſignifies actively, as well as paſſively, and is therefore in other places tranſlated in the active, as, <hi>ſubmit your ſelves, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted themſelves,</hi> &amp;c<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>See Rom.</hi> 10.3. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.16. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.22. <hi>Jam.</hi> 47. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5.5.</note>. The quality of this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is further characterized in the ſubſequent verſes, as, that it muſt extend ſo far as to exclude re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the power, we may not reſiſt, or caſt it off though we could (<hi>verſ.</hi> 2.) Yea, but on the other hand, we are to ſupport and maintain it, we are to miniſter unto it the materials whereby it may be kept up, and continued to rule over us (<hi>verſ.</hi> 6, 7.) and the ſubjection to it muſt be of conſcience, as the principle of conſcience is contradiſtinct from terror, and compulſory puniſhment (<hi>verſ.</hi> 5.) and further the aforeſaid ſupport and maintenance muſt be yeelded to it, as a due, and debt, and that owing not only to God the impoſer or ordainer, but of juſtice to the power it ſelf ordained. Now can a ſubjection of this nature, containing all theſe things he built upon the being of a thing by meer eventual Providence? the coming forth of a thing ſo of God can be no cogent, or ſolid reaſon for ſuch a ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto it. There are many things thus proceeding from and ordained of God, which we are not bound to acquieſce in, or let be as they are, much leſſe to maintain and uphold in their poſture; but our wils, our deſires, our prayers, our endevors may be, yea of duty muſt be againſt them. Death, ſickneſs, perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, wrongs, famines, plagues, predatory wars, and innumerable more things are providentially ordained of God at certain times here, and there
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:114672:80"/> to fall, and never come but by ſuch an ordination, yet may they be endevored to be repelled, or removed. And this is the reaſon which authors commonly give for their underſtanding the words not of a ſole provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential, but of an inſtitutive ordination<note n="*" place="margin">

There is indeed due unto every providence of God, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo inflicting or heavy, ſome kind of ſubjection, that is patience, or a contented and compoſed minde and behaviour under it, but there is a great deal of difference betwix this, and the ſubjection here due to the power. The work or office of the former, <hi>viz.</hi> of patience, is not to form the minde to will, or deſire the being or coming to paſſe of the thing which is to be born, nor to command the perſon to a concu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And this bearing it bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto only for preſent, or during the known in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbency of the evil, that is ſo far as it appears ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and inevitable, as being from the wil of Gods purpoſe, and impoſition of his hand; which kinde of ſubjection well admits and conſiſts with the uſe of means for the repelling, and of remedies for the cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and ending of the evil ſuſtained, the uſe of thoſe means, reſpecting not that which appears to be the wil of Gods counſel, but that which is to come, or that part and duration of the evil which is behind, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore uncertain to the bearer, whether God will have it to be or no. This is the ſubjection of patience, which therefore properly hath reference to a providential di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ordination, but the ſubjection of a relation of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriority in a civil ſtate, whereof the text treats, is of another ſtampe; it muſt ſway the mind to conſent to the power, to act for, &amp; contribute to its ſtanding, and to refrain all counter workings of hand, or ſpirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſame: and the ground hereof is, becauſe it hath reſpect to a divine ordination of inſtitution, the which inſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath preſcribed the power both to be,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:114672:81"/> and to have ſuch a poſture of ſubjection yeelded to it.</p>
                  <p>To ſay the power is ordained of God providenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and therefore to be ſubjected to with a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of this latter kind, to wit, which bars out all reſiſtance, or attempt to alter, or order any thing againſt its ſtanding, or proceeding, is to ſay, that whatever is ordained of God providentially is ſo to be ſubjected to: and what were this but to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid and put a Superſedeas upon all humane actions, and to bind all the men in the world to be as ſtill and void of motion as if they were dead, ſo that none of them in any affair may once ſtir, either hand, foot, tongue or thought? for there can be no motion of any of theſe, but it muſt carry in it an alteration, change; or ordering of ſomething other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then Providence hath already ordained it. For this we all ſay; the preſent poſture of all the things in the world, even to the placing of a Sparrow upon the ground, or the hair of a mans head, is orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by divine Providence; now no creature can move without altering in ſome particular the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent poſture of things; if then whatever is ordered by Divine Providence, muſt be ſo acquieſced in, or under, that none may attempt to counter-order, or alter any thing in it, every man is bound to a ſurceaſe of all action, even to the very drawing of his breath.</p>

Yea further, it is not only lawfull, but a duty to deny obedience to ſome of the Magiſtrates commands, backed with penalties, and not only ſo, but to act to the contrary of them, as is manifeſt by the example of the Apoſtles doing contrary to the prohibition and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The ordinary, (and I ſuppoſe rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal and expedient) reſtriction put upon the words is, the Power may not be reſiſted, that is, the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full being and proceeding of the power, that which is of God, is irreſiſtible; or all reſiſtance is forbidden which can be ſaid to be a reſiſtance of the ordinance of God (as to deſtroy the perſon in whom the power is placed by G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Now if we take the words, <hi>of God, ordained of God</hi> (which are the ſtrongeſt reaſon and meeteſt circumſcription of the irreſiſtance here inſiſted on) to ſignifie a providential efflux from God, there is no limitation in them, but an abſolute illegitima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all acts of reſiſtance, even of thoſe above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid to be generally, and juſtly allowable, as well as any other, and an impoſal of ſubjection, without any manner of reſiſtance, to all the outrages of the immaneſt Tyrant. All the injuries and illegalities of every Superiour are providentially diſpoſed of God, and therefore as wrapt up within this term <hi>Ordinance,</hi> ſo underſtood, would be irreſiſtible. It remains neceſſary therefore that we here take <hi>Ordained,</hi> and <hi>ordinance,</hi> in an inſtitutive, or legiſlative, not in a meer providential way of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination.</p>

The evill which God in his ſecret purpoſe intends, and his Providence is viſibly working to bring or to continue, it may be lawful, yea a duty for us to labour the not falling, or our eſcape of; as on the other hand we may, and ought to ſeek the attainment of thoſe good things, which God wils never to beſtow upon us. Wherefore if an endevor to reſiſt, and fruſtrate an ordination of Providence be a matter of no guilt, or demerit of damnation, it muſt not be ſimply that; but an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of precept which the Apoſtle here threatens with that ſentence.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Once more I argue from the reſiſtance, and the reſiſter of the Power condemned in the ſecond verſe. That cannot be the ſenſe of the term <hi>ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of God,</hi> which may be ſaid of him that reſiſteth the power, then when he reſiſteth, and in reſpect of his ſo doing, and that cannot be the ſenſe of that attribute <hi>the ordinance of God,</hi> which may be ſpoken of the reſiſters act of reſiſtance of the power; but to be in the place of power by eventual Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence may be ſaid of the reſiſter of the Power, then when he reſiſteth, and in reſpect of his ſo doing; and the reſiſters act of reſiſtence of the power, may be ſaid to be by a providential diſpoſal: Therefore a being in the place of power by eventual Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence cannot be the ſenſe of thoſe terms, <hi>ordained of God, the ordinance of God.</hi> Both the premiſes I take to be ſo clear as not to need confirming. If the minor ſhould be ſtuck at, I would ask what branch of it can be denyed, or counted any thing obſcure? I will only illuſtrate it by inſtance. Was not <hi>Abſalom,</hi> was not <hi>Athaliah</hi> in the place of power by eventual Providence? and was not both the one and the other a reſiſter of the power, the former of <hi>David,</hi> the latter of <hi>Joaſh?</hi> and was not their very being in, or occupying the place of power (as they did it, <hi>viz.</hi> by Trechery and violence) an act of reſiſtance of the power, in that thereby they
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:114672:82"/> kept out the power that was truly of God,<note place="margin">CHAP. V. SECT. III.</note> 
                     <hi>viz. David</hi> and <hi>Joaſh?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. To be <hi>ordained of God</hi> muſt needs be taken in ſuch a ſenſe as that the term may alwayes be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated of, or agree to every power that is inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Text; but if we take <hi>ordained of God</hi> to mean an actuall being in poſſeſſion, or place of rule by divine Providence, this cannot alwayes be predicated of, or agree to every power that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in the text. As it did appear in the laſt fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going argument, that ſuch a being in the place of rule may agree to ſome that are not the power, but are the reſiſters of the ſame; ſo here it may be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that it may not agree to them that indeed are the power. The Providence of God doth ſo order it ſometimes, that the Power or Civill Magiſtrate is not only diſturbed and diſquieted in, but outed and extruded from actual rule, or poſſeſſion of the ſeat of Magiſtracy, he ſtill remaining the power. That he that is the power may be providentially out of poſſeſſion will be fully argued a little after. Here I will only point at thoſe two even now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned inſtances. Who can deny but that <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Joaſh</hi> at what time they were diſſeiſed by <hi>Abſalom</hi> and <hi>Athaliah,</hi> were yet ſuch powers as the Apoſtle here means to command ſubjection to, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade thereto by this argument, becauſe they be <hi>of God, ordained of him?</hi> and that which befell thoſe two Princes may, at the pleaſure of God, be the providential lot of any other. Thoſe whom the precept of God (in this verſe) requireth to be obeyed, his Providence may at the ſame time ordain their diſſeiſure. Wherefore if it cannot be ſaid univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of all the powers included in this text, that they are providentially ordered of God in an actual rule or domination, we muſt take the text to intend ſome other kind of ordination, and that will be no other but an injunctive impoſal.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. I argue from the end for which the power is ordained of God, expreſſed (<hi>verſ.</hi> 3. &amp; 4.) which is to be a <hi>terror not to good works, but to the evill. To
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:114672:83"/> be a Miniſter of God to thee for good, to be a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil.</hi> Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators obſerving upon the words that the powers in their proceedings do not alwayes hold correſpondency to theſe ends or uſes,<note place="margin">Calvin. Pareus.</note> but not ſeldom do act directly counter to them, they therefore rightly tell us, the Apoſtle herein ſpeaks not what the Magiſtrate always is, or doth, but what he is ordained to be, and do; not what his action, but what his office or inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is; not what is <hi>de facto,</hi> but what ever ought to he, and <hi>de jure,</hi> is his level and ſcope. Here then is an evident ground to conclude it is not providenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, but preceptive ordination which the Apoſtle intends. Providential ordination doth ever take effect, or indeclinably accompliſh its end. The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference (as was before noted) betwixt theſe two ordinations (preceptive, and providential) is, that the former is often diſobeyed, and departed from by men to whom it is given, but the latter holds on its courſe, and attaineth his purpoſe without ſail; it never comes ſhort, or is defeated of its end. If we will ſay the ordination here meant is by Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and the Providence of God in the giving of all Magiſtrates propoſeth; and makes at this, that they be a terror not to good works, but to the evill, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We muſt thence ſay, it would then ſo come to paſſe, and be univerſally verified in every power, and in every adminiſtration of every power. But the contrary to the whole ſtrain of thoſe two verſes (<hi>viz.</hi> the 3. and 4.) experience findes to be the practiſe of divers Rulers. Whence I infer the ordination of God here intended is inſtitutive, or preceptive.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. And laſtly, Another argument there is to be raiſed from the conſideration of the end which the Apoſtle declares the Civill powers to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for; and it is this, The ordination that is here meant doth ſet up Powers, <hi>to be a terror not to good works, but to the evill; to be a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of God to thee for good; to be a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evill:</hi> and this we
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:114672:83"/> muſt underſtand to be their conſtant, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual end: but Providence doth not ſeldom or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain powers (in judgement, and for correction to people) for quite contrary ends to theſe<note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.11, <hi>to</hi> 18. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13, 11.</note>. So it is often that Rulers are not a terror to evill workers, but to the good, Miniſters of God for evill, executors of wrath not upon the evill, but upon the well-doer. And if ſo it come to paſſe, we muſt needs ſay it is ſo ordered by God in his Providence: and if the Providence of God doth ſo oftentimes intend and diſpoſe that Magiſtrates are a ſcourge to virtue, and indulgencers of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, then we cannot ſay, unleſſe we may ſpeak contradictories, that the ordination of the powers, by which they are ſet up conſtantly, and only for the puniſhment of evill doers, and the praiſe of them that do well, is an ordination meerly by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have diſcharged (as I could) the Second thing I propoſed to do for the opening of this term <hi>ordained of God,</hi> which was to lay down poſitively the ſenſe which I conceive it to bear in this place, with my Reaſons confirming and concluding the ſame, I goe on to the Third.</p>

                  <p>Ordination here, I conceive, intends as much as creation, production, or putting of the power in being.

                     <p>THis ordination or creation of the power muſt needs, I conceive, have in it two things.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is inſtitution, or the ordaining of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy to be in the ſtate, or civil ſociety. It is Gods preceptive ordinance that men in every poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique body ſhould have, and live under a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In this act of inſtitution may be contained not only the ſimple appointment of Magiſtracy to be, but the defining alſo of the office, or the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing what ſhall be the end, and what the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, compaſs, or bounds of its authority; how the Soveraign power ſhall rule, and be obeyed, what ſhall be neceſſary or allowable for him to do, and what to have.</p>
                     <p>The other is Conſtitution, which is the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that Inſtitution into act, and execution in particular ſtates. And this may have aſcribed to it two parts.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Specification, or the determining of the ſpecial kind of Government, comprehenſible under that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral inſtitution, or the ſetting down, which ſhall be the form<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> of policy <hi>pro bic &amp; nunc,</hi> or here and now, in this or that ſtate; whether Monarchy, Ariſtocracy, or another. And unto this Specification may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible the deſignment of the proportion, or lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude which this or that magiſtrate ſhall have. I ſhall
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:114672:85"/> not here enter into the diſpute, whether the ſupreme power be limitable otherwiſe then the general inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution it ſelf confines him. But I will ſuppoſe (the which is to me the more probable opinion) that there is a latitude in the allotment of power by that general inſtitution, and as ſome things are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and of the eſſence of ſupreme power, ſo other things are allowable or lawful; and being ſo, are left arbitrary, and referred to the choice and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the parties concerned in the conſtitution: and theſe may be the ſubject of that deſignation, or apportionating; as may be alſo the ſeveral ſhares or meaſures of power which each party ſhall have, where the ſupreme power is either mixt, or compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of ſeveral ſimple formes, or is diſtributed into ſeveral hands.</p>
                     <p n="2">2.

                     <p>That theſe acts muſt neceſſarily go to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or putting of the particular power in being, I think will not be queſtioned. It remains then to ſhew that they are, and how they are every one of them from God, and by his ordination, underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ordination in this ſenſe in which we have before conſtrued it.</p>

                        <hi>ſignifies that the powers are of God ordained, that is, are circumſcribed by certain limits and rules of right and honeſty, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in which rules unleſs they contain themſelves they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate from the ordinance of God.</hi> And this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcription doubtleſs muſt neceſſarily be admitted as well in relation to the aſſuming as to the uſing of the power.</p>
                     <p>Once more, If it were not ſo that Gods ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the powers doth import, not only that he inſtitutes magiſtracy to be, but that he conſtitutes every particular Magiſtracy, we could not ſay that an inſurrection againſt this, or any particular Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, or to depoſe him, and occupy his place were a ſin or a trangreſſion, and reſiſtance of Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance (as the Apoſtles words <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion intend) for to take away or controul a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Magiſtrate cannot otherwiſe be an entrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon Gods ordinance then upon the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Magiſtrates being ordained of God. So much (that God inſtitutes Government to be) would ſtand unſhaken by ſuch an act, or would conſiſt well with it; for ſtill, it notwithſtanding, it would be undetermined who were the power, and ſo it would be left as free and lawful for the reſiſter to take the place, as for the reſiſted to hold it; the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would be ſatisfied if any poſſeſſed it. Wherefore we muſt needs ſuppoſe God doth in every Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth conſtitute the proper and particular Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy, where ever it can be ſaid to be ordained of God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In regard God doth not ordinarily by any ſpecial revelation determine the conſtitution of the Civil ſtate, that is, point out what ſhall be the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:114672:88"/> ſpecial form of Government,<note place="margin">CHAP. V. SECT. IV.

                        </note>. Wherefore it muſt needs be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſeeing God by the law of nature hath injoyned government to be, but hath ordered no particular in it with application to ſingulars, he hath committed it to the poſitive tranſaction of men, to be diſpoſed according to certain general rules of juſtice, and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence given by him. It is not imaginable how God ſhould impoſe or require any diſtinct ſtate, or ſpecial relation, and order to be amongſt a multitude of men, or other his creatures, but be muſt be ſaid either immediately by himſelf to create it, or to ſet down from what cauſes, or out of what principles it ſhall ariſe.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. For the diſtinct underſtanding of the manner, or how many wayes God interpoſeth and concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in the conſtitution of particular Magiſtrates, in regard of which interpoſal the individual, or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular power may be aſcribed to Gods ordination, I ſhall note.</p>
                     <p>Some things God doth herein immediately, and ſome things mediately.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Immediately, and by himſelf he doth declare ſuch, and ſuch formes of Government to be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and eligible, and he doth order where and in whom the intereſt ſhall be to make choice which of thoſe forms in particular, and who the perſon or perſons ſhall be that ſhall be placed over this or that ſtate reſpectively.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="129" facs="tcp:114672:88"/>2. Mediately, and by men he doth enſtate eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſpecial kind of Government, and every particular Magiſtrate, that is, he doth ſet them up according to thoſe rules which we ſay are immediately given by him.</p>
                     <p>And this his mediate concurrence is two ways.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The authority or warrant of his word, rule or law goeth along with thoſe that act therein ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſame. And this is his moral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. His work or hand of Providence guideth the wils and exterior actions of them that proceed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thoſe rules; and this is his phyſical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
                     <p>We do not therefore exclude the Providence of God from the ordination of the powers that be: but we attribute to it its proper place and uſe; which is to perſue, and execute the authority and rule of his word, from which in the production of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy we cannot, neither ought by any means to ſeparate or disjoyn it, ſo as to make it conſtitutive of a Magiſtrate. And this act of Providence is far different from that which ſome would confound with it, and ſo put as the whole of ſole baſis of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill government, as to conſtitution, to wit, a perſons meer poſſeſſion, or occupation of the ſeat of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, or a bare phyſical predominancy: for this may be, and yet no Magiſtracy; and this, though it be due to the Civil Magiſtrate, yet it is ſeparable from it, as this diſcourſe I hope will manifeſt. The act of Providence which (as far as I can appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend) may be productive of Civill power is that which diſpoſeth of the title or right, and not of the meer poſſeſſion of the throne; that which guideth mens wils to conſent, or give a call, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer on the one part, and to accept of it on the other; and not that which only ſwayeth mens hands, on the one ſide lifting up an arme of force, as a puniſhment over a people, on the other binding the hands, and leading away captive Princes, and people, that however diſagreeing,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:114672:89"/> or relucting they can make no effectual reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Though God do not by immediate revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion aſſign to every particular State what ſhall be the ſpecial model of their government, and who the perſons to ſuſtain it, yet where men do act in the aſſignation of theſe for ſubſtance according to the preſcript or rule given out by God unto all, there is a power ordained of God, and (unleſs when a ſpecial revelation comes from God determining theſe particulars) there only, or not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
                     <p>This Propoſition hath two parts, a poſitive, and a negative.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The poſitive is, when men do act accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to divine rule, in the moulding of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and advancing of perſons to wield it, there the conſtitution may be ſaid (according to this text) to be of God, and the particular Government, and Governors to be ordained of God. Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diety of deſignation from God either of platform, or perſon is not neceſſary to the beſtowing of this ſtyle, <hi>of God, ordained of God,</hi> upon the particular Magiſtracy. It is in this caſe as it is in the point of any ordinary right or property. God hath ordained a perpetual law of juſtice among men <hi>(thou ſhalt not ſteal)</hi> by which every mans property in his goods is required to be reſerved to him; and he hath given, either in his word, or by the light, and law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a ſufficient rule to determine, what ſhall be right, what wrong, and how property in any poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſibles ſhall be acquirable; yet all this by it ſelf inveſts no man in any right to any goods in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar: it is a humane qualification or tranſaction which ſupervening, and being <hi>bona fide</hi> paſſed, now enſtates men in an actual right to any goods; and when this is emergent, this or that mans title or property in theſe particular goods is aſſerted by God, and then it may be ſaid, it is Gods ordinance that this man have and injoy theſe goods, and a tranſgreſſion againſt the ſame it is for another man without like warrant
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:114672:89"/> from God to diſſeiſe him of them. The truth is, the moſt, if not all, the moral precepts of God, and perpetual laws of nature are ſo made, and delivered to man, as that to the putting of them in practiſe, or the bringing of their obligation into act there muſt intervene ſome poſitive conſtitution either from God or man, and moſt commonly it is from the latter.</p>
                     <p>The Schools tell us that humane poſitive conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions do determine the law of nature as the form ſpecificates the matter, or the particular matter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines the generall<note n="*" place="margin">Vide <hi>Cajetan</hi> in <hi>Aquin. 1. 2</hi>ae. qu. <hi>95.</hi> art. <hi>2.

                        </note>. That wives, children, ſervants, ſubjects own their reſpective ſuperiors, and pay them their duties is the law of God, but there are certain humane acts which are the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate foundation and riſe of theſe relations, and ſo of perſons lying under the duties, which ſeverally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to them; which acts once paſſed the bounds of relation, and duty do take hold of the perſons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively by virtue of the divine ordination. <hi>Our Saviour</hi> ſaith of marryed perſons, <hi>What God hath joyned together let no man put aſunder.</hi> Marriage then in all marryed couples is a conjunction made by God; but how comes that ſeeing moſt that marry have no recourſe to, or particular direction from God, when, whom, or how to marry, probably never think of any ordinance of God about it, but only to follow their own or others counſels and wils in it? Why thus it is, God in the beginning authorized marriage to be betwixt man and woman, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed how it ſhould be tranſacted, to wit, by the mutual conſent, or cleaving together of each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: and enacted other rules concerning it, as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proximity of bloud, &amp;c. And now by virtue of this his ordinance, what ever couple do accordingly contract, are joyned together by God. The ſame may be exemplified in the office of the Miniſtery of the Goſpel. <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath given commiſſion to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in the Church to ordain Elders, and when ſuch are accordingly ordained, they a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:114672:91"/> goes not only a law of God univerſally enacting Civil Government to be, but a further ſpecificating act of God, whereby be conſtituteth this ſpecial platform for this Common-wealth, and cals forth, or authorizeth this perſon, or theſe perſons here to bear it; and that this he doth, either by imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate revelation, or by the intervention of men qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified, and inſtructed by his ſet rule to make the ſaid aſſignation, then it muſt needs be yeelded that none can be entitled to the plea, and priviledge of being Gods ordinance, but they that come in by that door, or aſcend by that ſcale.</p>
                     <p>It will (I think) be ſaid by all, that Gods ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the power doth not neceſſarily import his d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And hereupon it will be to be inferred, that either God hath left this determination to men abſolutely, indefinitly, and promiſcuouſly, giving way to any that will, in any place whatſoever, to conſtitute what Magiſtracy, and whom in it they pleaſe, (and who hath ſo little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding either of God, or of the matter hereby attributed to him, as to ſay this?) or elſe that he hath ſet a ſtint, and fixed rule to men in this matter, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing certain to conſtitute the Government, and obliging people to the owning of the Government ſo conſtituted, as from him, with excluſion, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowance of any other to determine theſe things. And if this be the way (as to me it ſeemeth ſo clear as that no other is imaginable) then, if in the erecting of government a ſubſtantial deviation from it be, as when incompetent, or unallowed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons be the advancers of themſelves, or others unto the place of power, in as much as in that caſe there lies the divine diſapprobation, and men act beſides the ſaid preſcript, it may be ſaid there is no ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, but a contradiction, and contraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to Gods order.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. That the ſaid rule, or the ſpecial way by which men ſhould be called, or attain to the place of Soveraign power, and expreſly defined in Scripture is not neceſſary, or to be, as ſuch, exacted. We all grant that God hath in reference to all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietable things of this life, and to all tranſactions about them injoyned a rule of right and equity to be kept, and forbidden the tranſactions about them, injoyned a rule of right, and equity to be kept, and forbidden the tranſgreſſion of it, yet he hath not in his written word particularly ſtated the ſeveral wayes by which the right, or title to a thing ſhall be acquired, nor yet the ſpecial lawes, or rules by which the property of perſons to ſuch things may be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, or adjudged. This the law and light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in mans heart as to many, or moſt things, or caſes, is left to diſcover: and this it hath done, in moſt things indifferent clearly, and equally, in ſo much as the affaires of men about them are ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, and both by vulgar maxims, and cuſtoms, and by publique laws, and judgements regularly compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and determined.</p>

                        <pb n="137" facs="tcp:114672:92"/>2. And yet we are not without ſome Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in this particular. Even it doth not only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe an orderly call to the adminiſtration of Civill power, and condemn the unorderly and violent aſſumption of it; [<hi>Num.</hi> 27.26, 27. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.14. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 8.4. <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.21. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 23.16. <hi>Amos</hi> 6.13.] but doth alſo direct the way how men ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to it, and by whom, in caſe of vacancy of Magiſtracy. This it doth in the particular caſe of that nation to whom God at firſt gave his writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten law, which may be a pattern to other Nations in this, as in other matters confeſſedly it is. See the direction to them, [<hi>Deut.</hi> 17.14, 15. &amp; 16.18. &amp; 1.13.] In which places the tranſacting of this affair is by order from God put into the hands of the community, over whom the Magiſtracy is ſet. <hi>Judges and Officers ſhalt thou make thee in all thy gates which the Lord thy God giveth thee, throughout thy tribes, and they ſhall judge the people with juſt judgement.</hi> And unto this order ſeems the ſpeech of that good man, and wiſe Statiſt to refer, [2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.18.] <hi>Nay but whom the Lord and this people, and all the men of Iſrael chooſe, his will I be, and with him will I abide.</hi> And according to this preſcript runs the promiſe of God to the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> concerning their ſtate after the return of their <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.21. <hi>And their Nobles ſhall be of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and their Governor ſhall proceed from the midſt of them.</hi> And anſwerable to this rule we finde in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the people conſtituting their Supreme Governour; as in the advancement of <hi>Jeptha, Jud.</hi> 10.5, &amp;c. of <hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 11.1, &amp;c. and others. And I would ask them who ſeem willing to deny that in the <hi>Bible</hi> any commiſſion is given to a prople to chooſe themſelves Governors, to what purpoſe is it that the Lord giveth by <hi>Moſes</hi> directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and rules what manner of perſon the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſhould ſet up to be King over them, as it is [<hi>Deut.</hi> 17.14, 15, &amp;c.] if they had no intereſt, or commiſſion given them to ſet up, or chooſe any for themſelves?</p>

So that whether we look into the Scriptures, or into the Book of Natures law, the way which God hath chalkt out, the ordinary means he uſeth for the deputation of perſons under himſelf, and over the people in the office of the Supreme Civil power, is the vote, elective act, or conſent of the body politique, or people to be ruled.

                        <hi>To take away all ſuch mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual grievance, injuries, and wrongs, there was no way but only by growing upon compoſition, and agreement amongſt themſelves, by ordaining ſome government publique, and by yeelding themſelves ſubject thereunto, that unto whom they granted authority to rule and govern, by them the peace, tranquillity, and happy eſtate of the reſt might be procured, without which conſent there was no reaſon why one man ſhould take upon him to be Lord, or Judge over another. — Over a whole grand multitude, having no ſuch dependency (as is in the family upon the Father) upon any one, and conſiſting of ſo many families, as every politique ſociety in the world doth, impoſſible it is that any ſhould have compleat lawful power, but by conſent of men, or immediate appointment of God; becauſe not having the natural ſuperiority of fathers, their power muſt needs be either uſurped, and then unlawfull, or if lawful, then either granted, or conſented unto by them over whom they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe the ſame, or elſe given extraordinarily from

                     <p n="1">1. That which I ſhall take notice of, firſt is, <hi>the power or right of Fatherhood,</hi> which is ſupported or pieced out (by the maintainers of it) with that of <hi>primogeniture, or of the firſt born;</hi> both of theſe put together they ſtyle (as I underſtand them) by the name of <hi>Genarchy.</hi> The drift of their opinion that are for this is to make the riſe, and right of Civill Government natural and native, not voluntary, or conventional.</p>

But the queſtion is, whether Fatherhood and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeniture, either of them apart, or both of them together be the proper title, baſis, or root of Civill Magiſtracy? or, whether a natural, and original right, and title to political rule be in the Father, and firſt-born, without any poſitive voluntary, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane conſtitution, or conſent of the ſtate; ſo that a perſon is in ſoveraign power not by virtue of any ſuch law or paction, but meerly, and originally by his Fatherhood or primogeniture?</p>
                     <p>Firſt, for the title of Fatherhood to Magiſtracy, there are theſe things that impugne it.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Although it is granted there is in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a power over his child, yet ever ſince the erection of the publique State, or Comm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n-wealth, as a diſtinct ſociety from that of a houſhold, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of a multitude of families, and where ever theſe two are in being together, the paternal power hath been (and that duly, and neceſſarily) taken to be another, or a diſtinct authority from that of the Civil Magiſtrate, and inferior, or ſubordinate to it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The power of the Father is in every Father over his children: and if from it you will raiſe a Civil Political power, then, either it muſt be ſaid to be in, or to be the right of every Father; and if ſo, as ſoon as one begets a child, or becomes a Father, he becomes a Supreme Civil Power, begins a new Common-wealth, and he, and his children are exempt from his Fathers (if living) and all other Civil ſuperiority; and the Fathers power, and the Common-wealth he is over ſhall be diſſolved by his having Nephews, or by his childrens fatherhood:
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:114672:97"/> and this will make every family, though but of two perſons, to be a Civil State, and that no Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth can conſiſt of more then the children of one Father, and for ever prevent or deny the compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a Common-wealth of many families, and the diſtinction of the Common-wealth from the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And by this multiplication of the number, and abridgement of the extent of civil ſocieties you diſappoint mankind of that union, ſtrength, ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and comfortable commerce that nature hath guided men to ſeek, and the experience of all ages and nations have found in large and populous ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties. Or</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The political power muſt be ſaid to be in, or to be the right of every Father that is not <hi>Pater patratus,</hi> or that hath no Father; and this doth diſſolve and divide the Common-wealth at the death of ſuch a Father into ſo many parts as there are left perſons fatherleſſe, whether they be Wife, Sons, or Daughters, and into ſo many new Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths as there are left Fathers in it that have not a Father.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The right or power of the Father can relate only to the children, and only to his own. Out of the extent then of this dominion, and conſequently out of the Common-wealth it belongeth unto, upon this ſcore you muſt exclude,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Wife, and Servants of this ſuppoſed Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, though he be their ſuperiour, and they in a ſubordination to him, yet he is not their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. All other perſons of any other ſtock; there can be no mixture of races, or linages in this Common-wealth.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. If Civil power be the right of the Father, then it muſt neceſſarily be in him in reference to all his children, wherever placed, or diſperſed. So that how far ſoever <hi>Adams</hi> progeny muſt be diſſemina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or ſpread upon the face of the earth, during his life; or <hi>Noahs</hi> during his life; or any of the long lived Patriarchs during their reſpective lives, all the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:114672:97"/> poſterity that ſprang from ſuch a head, muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to, and be ſhut up within one Common-wealth while that common parent laſted. And how will this ſtand with that diſtribution of <hi>Noahs</hi> race into ſeverall Countreys and Nations in his life time, as alſo with that of <hi>Shems,</hi> he being living? (of which in the 10 and 12 Chapters of <hi>Geneſis</hi>) and with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> ſending away the ſons he had by his Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines into another Countrey while he yet lived? <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.6.</p>
                     <p>Unleſs it will be ſaid, ſuch a Father hath a facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or warrant to ſtrip himſelf of this his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Civill Dominion, and to transfer it, or any part of it to others during his life, But</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Thus you unſettle and change the baſis, and cauſe of civil dominion you had laid in the Fathers natural right, and make it ſeparable from it by humane choice, and will: and if you put it once upon arbitrary conſtitution you make it alienable for ever from that ſubject, and from that bottom.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This cannot be ſuppoſed at the confuſion of languages (<hi>Gen.</hi> 11.6, 7.) when as they were one immediately before it; and the end of their building <hi>Babel</hi> was to prevent their diſperſion; and upon that confuſion they were ſcattered from thence upon the face of the whole earth; by which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and diſperſion the conſent, or act of their common head, for the diveſting of himſelf, and for the inveſting of thoſe who ſhould ſucceed him, in being the reſpective Soveraign powers of thoſe ſeveral divided Countries and nations, was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, But the inconveniencies of fixing Civil power in the paternal relation alone they endevour to ſalve by eeking it out with that of primogeniture. Unto this I ſay,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Primogeniture can never be ſuppoſed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive any thing to the childe, but what was in the Father; if the Father be a Supreme power, a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy may by it be conveyable to his Son, and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:114672:98"/> not otherwiſe. Thus primogeniture is not the riſe of civil power, but ſuppoſeth it to be in being, and is only the mean of continuation, and tranſmiſſion of it from perſon to perſon.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The natural right of the firſt born in ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the Father, as we finde it in Scripture, ſeems only to be a better, or double portion of what was his Fathers, in copartnerſhip with his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. If then you go by that, you muſt upon the death of every royal father, that hath a plurality of Sons divide the Common-wealth among them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that proportion; whereby it would come to paſſe that a Kingdom by many deſcents probably ſhall be divided into numberleſſe minute principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and every of them ſtill new to be divided by every new ſucceſſion. The conveying of a Kingdom whole and entire to one of many Sons is not from the law of the firſt born in Scripture, but is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs from poſitive inſtitution. And this is to me a ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ong argument (and unanſwerable to them that allow the transferring of Kingdoms undivided from Father to Childe) that Supreme power is in a perſon by arbitrary conſtitution, not by natural right as in a Father or firſt-born; for if it were, that right by it ſelf would infer a diviſion of Common-wealths according to the multiplication of the Regal ſtock, and ſo in time an eaſie diſſolution of them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If Primogeniture muſt carry it, then the right of Fatherhood a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

For upon his death either the power muſt deſcend upon every one of his children diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butively, as Fathers in reference to their reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive children as their ſubjects; and then where is that you call the right of primogeniture, and what politicall power is accrewed by it? or, it muſt deſcend upon his firſt-born only, and then what becomes from thenceforth of the right of fatherhood?</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <pb n="149" facs="tcp:114672:98"/>4. If you ſet the Civill power upon the firſt born in ſucceſſion from <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo downward, then you muſt either ſet it upon every fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This may confidently enough be affirmed, It cannot be ſaid of any perſon, or family in the world, nor could have been for theſe many ages, that he, or it claimeth, or holdeth the throne in ſuch a nation by a right of Fatherhood, or Primogeniture derived from the firſt father, or firſt eldeſt ſon.</p>

How many queſtions do Civilians agitate about the right of ſucceſſion where the linage is known? and what different rules and methods of ſucceſſion do they obſerve in ſeveral Nations and Kingdoms?

There is a queſtion about the matter into which the ſucceſſion is to be; to wit, whether if a man have a plurality of iſſue, the dominion ſhall paſſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided to one, or be diſtributed into many portions, that is, to every childe a ſhare. There is ſome queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſucceſſion to him that hath iſſue; as, whether a mans firſt-born dying before him, and leaving iſſue, the iſſue of that ſon, or his own ſecond-born ſhall inherit.

                     <p>The reſult of all this is, that the authors of this title of Government muſt be driven to confeſs it now out of uſe, and to be an impoſſible thing, to build any ſoveraign power that now is, or can be expected to be, or for moſt of the ages of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde paſt, hath been in the world, upon it. Hence is it that after all their diſcourſes upon it they tell us, in relation to all Governments that have been ſince the confuſion of families, of <hi>an elective primogeniture</hi> (a contradiction <hi>in adjecto:</hi>) and that <hi>thoſe Supreme Magiſtrates the world hath now, or can have, ſucceed in the place of the Father and firſt-born.</hi>

I will only take a little notice of the main and cornerſtone, which the friends of this opinion lay to found it upon, and ſo paſſe from it. This is <hi>the univerſal Monarchy which they preſuppoſe</hi> Adam <hi>had from God; and which, or any part whereof none of his poſterity could have, but by grant, or ſucceſſion from him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But let this be ſuppoſed, what will be gained by it to their purpoſe?</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Touching the univerſal Monarchy of <hi>Adam,</hi> it will be queſtioned how he had, or received it? Whether by natural right, as the Father of all, or by an immediate expreſſe and poſitive grant from God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Beſides the way of immediate and expreſſe grant from God, which it may be ſuppoſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>Adam,</hi> and after him ſome other ſpecial perſons (as <hi>Moſes, Saul, David</hi> had) there muſt be acknowledged a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate, and ordinary way of Gods advancing of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to authority, and power, which is ſtanding, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and common to all times, and places. And of this our controverſie is. I enquire therefore how this univerſal Monarchy of <hi>Adam</hi> paſſed from him unto others.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Whether diſtributively, and piecemeal to many, that is to his ſons, cach a ſhare, or whole, and ſolid to one?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Whether it paſſed from him to them, or any of them by his arbitrary and poſitive aſſignement, or by order, or law of nature, as to the heir, or heirs general.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If by his voluntary aſſignement it paſſed to whom, and in what proportion he pleaſed, then the natural right of Fatherhood or Primogeniture took no place at his death, carryed not the Civil power from him, and ſo cannot challenge to convey it down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. If by order or law of nature it paſſed from him, then the queſtion will be,</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="157" facs="tcp:114672:102"/>1. Whether they that ſucceeded to him had it by right of Progenitorſhip, that is, by reaſon of the Fatherhood which was in them in relation to their poſterity, who were therefore their ſubjects, ſo that upon that title, every ſon of <hi>Adam</hi> was ſoveraign to the iſſue that came of him. But then it will be ſaid, this courſe of deriving Supreme Magiſtracy could be but temporary, and muſt needs have a ſtop, for otherwiſe it would multiply Common-wealths <hi>in infinitum,</hi> according to the multiplication of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and confine Common-wealths to extend no further, then to compriſe a Father and his children, which (as was argued before) is neither agreeable to the practiſe of men, even from the time of <hi>Noah,</hi> nor to the end of a Common-wealth, which is union of a multitude of houſeholds for ſtrength, and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. When therefore this courſe of <hi>Genarchy</hi> ceaſed, what was the way of continuing Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Or it paſſed from <hi>Adam</hi> by right of inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, to <hi>Adams</hi> ſons, as his ſons, and ſo as heirs of their Father. And this is a way different from that of Progenitorſhip, and upon this point the right of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood and that of Primogeniture are at odds, and prove (as to the purpoſe of conveying power from <hi>Adam</hi>) inconſiſtible. For if the Civil power went by Fatherhood, then were all <hi>Adams</hi> ſons joynt ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors in it (as was before ſaid) every one in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his poſterity: if it went by primogeniture, but one of them could by that claim the power, and this will run as upon the neceſſi y of having but one Monarchy over all mankind, throughout all ages, which was above diſproved. Unleſs we muſt ſay the firſt-begotten could but claim a double portion of power, and then the reſt of the ſons had each a ſingle part in proportion to his double. But this,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Fals again upon the abſurdity even now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged of multiplying Common-wealths by the endleſſe number of Fathers.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="158" facs="tcp:114672:103"/>2. Out of what, or whom would you make the eldeſt ſon a double portion? without depriving ſome other of the ſons of his ſingle part, and ſo deſtroying the right of inheritance, to it you could make no addition to the ſingle ſhare of the firſt born, or give him dominion over more then he was ſuperiour to by virtue of his own Fatherhood.</p>
                     <p>To make an end therefore with this point, if the inſiſting on the meer natural right either of Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, or Primogeniture will not beat us out a clear path for the derivation of Government from <hi>Adam,</hi> or carrying it on with ſome juſtifiableneſs of title among men, then we muſt return to that of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary agreement, and grant; unto which the true natural right of Fatherhood is not repugnant, but may very well be reconciled, yea, and aſſiſtant unto the founding, and continuing Civil Government. Some of them that inſiſt on the Fathers power as the only Civil Power in the world, do yet place in him a right to transfer it from himſelf, unto whom he pleaſeth. If this be granted then I will ſay the way of ſetling Civil authority by the agreement, or conſent of the governed, might thus come in. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe we <hi>Adam</hi> to have ruled as ſole Monarch during his life; afterward ſome one of his ſons in ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to him, or all his ſons each over their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny as diſtinct ſocieties; after by the confuſion of languages they being forced to ſever; or when thoſe diſtinct races of <hi>Adam</hi> became ſo numerous, and diſperſive over many countries that they were too vaſt to be continued in one ſociety, they may be ſuppoſed each of them voluntarily to withdraw, or part themſelves into ſeveral Common-wealths, and the Fathers of the families in every of theſe new erected Common-wealths having in them the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of power each in relation to his children, and family, and agreeing together for themſelves, and theirs to ſome one as their publique civil-head, or King; and thus cometh in Magiſtracy to be vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily conſtituted in that way wherein the right of Fatherhood is preſerved, and continued in ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:114672:103"/> to the Civil publique power; and this put in ſuch a way, as both it, and politique ſocieties of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient amplitude might be kept up, and new ones (as need ſhould require) might be erected; whereas by the meer right of Fatherhood, holding, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing the power it had in relation to thoſe only who were natural children to it, it could not be, no not with the ſupplement of Primogeniture, as was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhewed. And with this the <hi>Aſſertors of the ſole right of Fatherhood are driven</hi> in a ſort to comply<note n="*" place="margin">See the Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. <hi>11.</hi>

Many times by the act either of uſurper himſelf, or of thoſe that ſet him up, the true heir of a Crown is diſpoſſeſſed. In ſuch caſes the ſubjects obedience to the Fatherly power muſt go along and wait upon Gods providence, who only hath right to give, and to take away Kingdoms, and thereby to adopt ſubjects into the obedience of another Fatherly power</hi>
                        <note n="†" place="margin">The Anarchy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> pag. <hi>12.</hi>
                        </note>. Hereby the Fatherly right, and power are made a meer <hi>Equivocum,</hi> or to ſignifie power en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled, or coming in any way whatſoever, though it do not only not derive from the right of Fatherhood,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:114672:104"/> but be privatively oppoſed to, or deſtructive of it: and thus he confounds, and makes to meet together in one name, and title, the thing that he had argued againſt, with the thing that he had aſſerted. And the ſaying that <hi>Providence in diſpoſſeſſing of a Crown, him that is the true heir (and ſo hath the right) and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it to the hands of an unjuſt invader, doth put a fatherly power in that invader, and adopt the ſubjects to an obligation to it;</hi> is to deny the right both of paternity and birth-right, and of the conſent of the people, and of every other ſpecial way of conveying a title to Government, and to make the right there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of only to follow, come by, and conſiſt in poſſeſſion, and to die forthwith in the Father, and heir upon diſpoſſeſſion. And to what purpoſe then is all his plea for Fatherhood, and primogeniture, or any other mans for any other title? what a void diſtinction is that of his when he diſtinguiſheth of a natural, and an a uſurped right?

Forfeiture as it is a ſingular exception that lies in many caſes, ſo it preſuppoſeth a law, or conſtitution that ordains it, and ſo in a ſort involveth their conſent of whom it is taken.

In like manner as we account that to be by a mans will, or conſent, which his Predeceſſors (in whom he is virtually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded) have willed, or himſelf hath formerly gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, though now he be quite of another minde.

As Conqueſt may intereſt a perſon in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by being an attainment of poſſeſſion in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of an antecedent right, ſo the other ſort of conqueſt, to wit, that which is a ſeaſing of anothers right, or the ſetting of a man in meet poſſeſſion, may have ſome tendency thereto, though not ſo directly, and that is thus; It may be an inducement to the conquered (if they be indeed free, and unen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to any other) to a ſubmiſſion, and delivery up of themſelves to be the ſubjects of the victor, and to take him for their Soveraign. The former way conqueſt is poſtnate and ſubſequent to the right of the Conquerer, and ſo doth not give him his title, but only introduce his poſſeſſion; this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter way it is antecedaneous, previous, and prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to his title, but is not productive or conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of it.

                        <hi>If no man have power to take away his own life, without the guilt of being a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer of himſelf, how can the people confer ſuch a power as they have not themſelves, upon any one man without being acceſſories to their own deaths?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Reaſon ſeems to ground it ſelf upon that common Axiome, <hi>Nihil dat quod non habet;</hi> whence it argues, the people cannot give the power of capital puniſhment over them unto any perſon, becauſe they have it not, cannot inflict it, each upon himſelf. But it is miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Here is <hi>ignoratio clenchi.</hi> For, as we yeeld it true that the people have not a civill authority every one over his own life, ſo we do not ſay, but here deny, that they can confer it upon another. The conceſſion of a power in the people to nominate,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:114672:108"/> or elect their Soveraign doth not infer ſo much, <hi>viz.</hi> that they in ſo doing give, or confer upon him the Magiſtratical power. They may be ſubordinate agents, and their vote, or conſent may be the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium, or inſtrument uſed by God to convey that power to the perſon, but they cannot therefore be ſaid to be the Creators, efficients, authors, or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of that power, for that is the properwork or prerogative of God. When the <hi>young Prophet</hi> came to <hi>Jehu,</hi> and poured the oyle upon his head, and ſaid unto him, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God of Iſrael, I have anointed thee King over the people;</hi> can we ſay, that Prophet made <hi>Jehu</hi> King? That young man was not the author, but the meſſenger only of that buſineſs. It is very clear in the conveyance of this, and of other powers, one may be the <hi>vehi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum,</hi> the hander over of that power to another, which he is not the poſſeſſor of himſelf. A ſingle woman hath not in her the marital power over her ſelf, yet by her conſent in marriage ſhe conveyes it to her husband. The people of a Chriſtian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, or Church have not each the power of a Paſtor, or Miniſter to Preach, adminiſter a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, or the Keyes of Diſcipline to himſelf, yet by their election they may be inſtrumentall to convey the ſame to another. When the King in whom the power of life, and death is, gives com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to a Judge to have, and execute it ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately from, and for him, and ſends his order to the Keeper of his ſeal (required by the Law to make ſuch a Commiſſion authentick) to paſſe and ſeal the ſaid Commiſſion; we cannot ſay, the Keeper gives the Judge the ſaid Commiſſion, but it is the King <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>hat conferres it by this Officers hand. That which the peoples conſent doth when they agree that this perſon ſhall be their Supreme Governour, is to determine the general rule (that every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth ſhall have a Magiſtracy with power of capital puniſhment) to the particular perſon in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to that people; but it makes them not to be conferrers efficients, or primary cauſes of that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy.</p>

                     <p>When a power or priviledge is by divine inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on annexed to the act of the creature, it is not the creatures act properly, or efficiently, but God by his inſtitution that communicates that power, or priviledge.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This Objection, in its proper tendency, doth not more argue againſt he peoples capaci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the power over life upon any perſon (which is a thing we affirme not) then it doth againſt the peoples giving their conſent, that ſuch a one ſhall have the ſaid power over them. For upon the ſame medium it may be argued, if no man have power to take away his own life without the guilt of being a ſelf-murderer, how can any people con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to ſuch a power in another without being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſories to their own deaths? But that the people may very lawfully give their conſent to ſuch a power in another, I hope the Objector will not deny; If he ſhould, I would ſay the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did lawfully give their conſent to ſuch a power in <hi>Saul, David, Solomon,</hi> and others; yea it is the part of every people to conſent to the Rulers to have it, unleſs we muſt ſay that all Subjects are to be under their Governors againſt their wils.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But how then muſt we avoid the Reaſon, If I may not take away or deſtroy mine own life, I may not agree that another ſhall have the power to do it?</p>
                     <p>I anſwer, This is a very falſe aſſertion, that power which one hath not, and may not himſelf exerciſe, he may not conſent to in another; If by power be meant (as it muſt needs be in the Objection) a power that is in its own nature lawful. Indeed that which is ſimply, or in it ſelf unlawful, (as for inſtance, Murder) becauſe it is ſo unlawful, as I may not do it my ſelf, ſo I may not conſent to anothers doing of it: But that which is lawful in it ſelf, but unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to me (as many things are) becauſe though good in it ſelf, yet I am not thereto called, or authorized, of that I cannot ſay, becauſe I cannot do it my ſelf,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:114672:109"/> I may not conſent to it in another. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> did give his conſent to the taking away of his own life (conditionally if he deſerved death, and the objection imports no other conſent) when he was in queſtion about it before his Judge<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Act.</hi> 25.11.</note>. <hi>If I be an offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe not to die.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. From this antecedent, no man hath power to take away his own life without the guilt of ſelf-mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the concluſion would as well be, not only <hi>(ergo)</hi> the people cannot, but <hi>(ergo)</hi> no man can confer ſuch a power on another, and thus the argument would run, as againſt the peoples, ſo againſt any others conferring, (or conſenting to, as to their ſenſe who make the terms equivalent) ſuch a power in another; ſo that by this it ſhould be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. For a Prince, or any other Supreme power to tranſmit, reſigne, or put off their Government in their life time to another, which yet the Author of this objection allowes.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. For one that is a ſubject to no State, to deſire or offer himſelf to, or accept of naturaliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or incorporatien in any Common-wealth, under any civil power.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. For one that is a member of a Legiſlative aſſembly, and out of it but a ſubject, to give his vote to an act for the puniſhing of a crime with death, by which his own life is concerned, as ſubjected to death by the ſaid act upon his breach of the ſame. Yet I ſuppoſe no man can defend any of theſe to be unlawful. And for the laſt it is very ordinary, and generally allowed, and the reaſon is; Becauſe ſuch a perſons vote, and the ordaining of ſuch a law doth not create a power of life, and death, nor confer it <hi>de novo</hi> on the Magiſtrate to whom the execution of it is committed. It only doth deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, or apply that power which is already inſtituted by God, and inherent in the Magiſtrate, to its par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular matter, ſuch a fact: or, make that power which was in him <hi>in actu ſignato,</hi> to be in him <hi>in actu
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:114672:109"/> exercito,</hi> in reference to ſuch a crime. As therefore a Parliament mans vote conduceth to determine, or apply that power which was in ſome ſort in being before to its particular matter, this fact; ſo doth the peoples vote determine that power which was in ſome ſort ordained before, that is, inſtituted by God, to its particular ſubject, this perſon. I have thus diſpatched their Herculean argument; let us ſee what more is ſaid.</p>

It muſt be ſuppoſed that nature hath ordained (upon ſuppoſal of the multiplication, and ſpreading of men over the ſeveral regions of the earth) a partition of men into divers civil Societies, to be under diſtinct, and peculiar civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

                     <p n="1">1. Not by Conſanguinity, or tye of bloud, for this is in ſome degree extenſive to all mankinde: and for a confinement of it within any certain degrees whereby to make a diviſion of Common-wealths,</p>

For in this caſe, the very end of a multitudes aſſociating, and becoming one Common-wealth, and the being, and intereſt of them as ſuch is concerned that ſo it be.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. From a peoples becoming one ſociety, there doth reſult in them a faculty, and intereſt to act ſome things politically: all being is in order to action, and every <hi>actus primus</hi> is for an <hi>actus ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus;</hi> and a Political being is for Political operation;

This occaſion of a peoples agreement about politique Government but rarely occurreth, but when a Government is ſetled, whether by our, or by the Objectors means, the dayly management of it is much more obnoxious to theſe impediments in the perſon, or perſons in whom it is ſeated; and when one of them ſeiſeth on ſuch a ſubject, it is prone to make a greater interruption in publique concernments then all of them are wont to do in this, yet are Salvos in thoſe caſes ordinarily found out.</p>

This indeed is the power of which the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is, and which wants a lineal heir, or ſubject to bear it, upon the ſuppoſed death of the King: And if that deſcend upon them, it muſt either be in that manner ſpecified, or elſe ſo as each perſon of them is the adequate poſſeſſor of the whole, and ſolid power, which I ſuppoſe will not be ſaid: If that then be his meaning, lo here a <hi>Democracy</hi> yielded, and ſet up by him who elſewhere holds there is no ground for any ſuch or any other po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larchical forme of Government, and that Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy is the only warranted form.

Indeed that domeſtical power which was in each of them before in relation to his particular, and private fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily they being left deſtitute of a Superior, or Political head, hath another habitude then it had before, being become negatively Supreme, that is, it hath none actually above it, but it is the ſame power ſtill; or, if we ſhall ſay the power of the <hi>Pater familias</hi> in this vacancy may be put forth unto ſome acts in relation to the perſons in his houſe, which he might not exerciſe while the Common-wealth had a Magiſtrate, I ſhall not diſpute that, but only ſay, though the Oeconomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call power be ſomewhat larger, <hi>in actu exercito,</hi> when unſubordinate to a Political Soveraign then it is being ſubordinate, yet it is within the compaſſe of Oeconomical ſtill, and the ſame it was <hi>in actu ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nato.</hi> And that which he cals a Power divolved upon the head of the family by the Soveraigns death, is but the drawing forth into act of that which was in him before, but was ſuſpended by the politicall relation, and ſubjection. That which then can be ſaid to Eſcheat to the heads of families by ſuch
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:114672:116"/> death of their King is a power to diſpoſe of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſubjection to another, and of their votes for the election of him to be their Soveraign toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (if you will, with a larger compaſs for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of their paternal power in their families) during their want of Magiſtracy.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. What if thoſe perſons where no Fathers, but were ſingle, and unſociate as to ſuch a relation, that is, what if they were not over any other, or if they had no families, or children ſprung from, or belonging to them, would not then the ſaid power in the ſaid caſe Eſchear, or belong to them? If he ſay no, I demand his reaſon: if he ſay it would, then he muſt ſay it doth not Eſcheate to them as they are Fathers of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but as perſons and people of that Common-wealth.</p>

Men that are Fathers of families cannot as ſuch be in a capacity of chooſing a King over them, they muſt beſides that relation be moreover united, and confederate in one Common-wealth, or elſe they cannot put forth that act of election. Perſons that are either <hi>non cives,</hi> or <hi>extraneae civitatis,</hi> have nothing to do in it. Whereby it is very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt the reaſon why men have that power of Election of a Magiſtracy to this, or that Common-wealth is not becauſe they are Fathers, but becauſe they are Deniſons, or freemen of that Common-wealth, and not comprehended or repreſented by any Domeſtical Superior, but immediately concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:114672:117"/> to act for themſelves in the common intereſts of the people of that Common-wealth.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Where he ſaith, <hi>The Power ſhall not eſcheat to the whole people, but to the Supreme heads, and Fathers of families.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I ſay, in that it eſcheats, to them (who are every one a part in his own family the Supreme head, or Father, that is, having none in this caſe above him in the Civil State) and to ſuch as, being without Domeſtical head, are capable of heading a family, whom I think he will not exclude, it eſcheates to the whole people; for who are the whole people to this effect, but they that are Maſters of families with them who are Maſters of themſelves? As was before ſhewed in anſwer to the ſecond Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the latter branch of it: and they chooſing, the whole people chooſe their Soveraign, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the people, either perſonally, or repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. In that he ſayes, <hi>Theſe Fathers chooſe a King by conferring their diſtinct, fatherly power upon one;</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is quite miſtaken, for</p>
                     <p n="1">1. They do not put off, or part with their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly powers, but retain each their own ſtill, when they have choſen their King.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The power which upon their election paſſeth into the hands of the Elected King, is more then all their Fatherly powers laid together, that is, a Supreme, Political, Civil, or Common-wealth power; which is a power of a higher Sphere, and differs not only in meaſure, but <hi>toto genere,</hi> or in kinde from that of the Fathers, and unto which the pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſtill continuing in the Maſters of families is ſubordinate.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Laſtly, As this Author cannot exempt theſe his words (if they muſt bear any ſound ſenſe) from a confeſſion of that which he contends againſt, both in this Treatiſe againſt Mr. <hi>Hunton,</hi> (and in his other of Obſervations upon <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks) <hi>viz.</hi> the riſe of Government from the

                     <p n="1">1. How will his arguing againſt the peoples capacity to chooſe their Soveraign by this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>That no man hath power to take away his own life, and therefore the people cannot confer this power upon another,</hi> conſiſt with the right of the Fathers of families to chooſe their King, whereas the power to take away their lives is a part of the power to which they chooſe him?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. How will this Eſcheature of the power to the heads of families, and their right thereby to chooſe their King, ſtand with what he ſaith preſently after? <hi>viz. That all Kings are either Fathers of the people, or heirs of ſuch Fathers or uſurpers of the right of ſuch Fathers:</hi> And that, <hi>when the true heir of a crown is diſpoſſeſſed by a uſurper, the ſubjects obedience of the Fatherly power muſt go along, and wait upon Gods Providence who only hath right to give, and take away Kingdoms, and thereby to adopt ſubjects to the obedience of another fatherly power.</hi> For if the power (in defect of a right heir) eſcheat to the Fathers of families, then it paſſeth not to an uſurper; and if thoſe have a right to chooſe their King, he that is choſen by them hath the right to be their King, and not the Uſurper; neither can the ſubjects be adopted to the obedience of another fatherly power ſuppoſed to be in him; neither is he that is choſen upon the fail of an ancient Royal line, or ſtock truly reducible to any of theſe three ſorts, <hi>viz. Either a Father of the people, or an heir of ſuch a Father, or an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper of the right of ſuch a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>

For in thus diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I ſhould only acknowledge thoſe acts of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, poſſeſſion, drinking, copulation <hi>in ſpecie,</hi> or in their univerſall an abſtract conceipt to be of God, not by any means that this act in particular wherein the judgement is unjuſt, the poſſeſſion is theeviſh, the drinking is exceſſive, the copulation is adulterous, is of God (in this ſenſe wherein we now ſpeak) or ordained of God. So in that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction betwixt the power, and the aſſumption of the power all that can be meant, with any favor of truth, is, that power in generall is of God, is the ordinance of God, but of this the queſtion is not; not that it may be ſaid the Uſurper, or the power which he aſſumeth, and uſurpeth is of God, is ordained by him, but not the uſurpation, or his way of aſſuming power: no more then it may be ſaid, this wrong judgement, this theeviſh poſſeſſion, this exceſſive drinking is of God, as his ordinance, but not the injuſtice, the robbery, the drunkenneſſe, the whoredome, or not the way wherein the agents act thoſe things.</p>
                  <p>No man (I think) ever yet ſaid that the act, and vitioſity of the act may be ſo abſtracted, or diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from each other, as to ſay, the one <hi>in indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduo</hi> may be morally good, and ſo of God, as his ordinance, and the other morally evill. It is eaſie to ſee that in an act whoſe matter is <hi>in ſpecie</hi> good, or lawfull, but other Ingredients which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute its moral individual ſtate, are evill, I cannot excuſe the act <hi>in individuo,</hi> or entitle it to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine

I would deſire to underſtand of them, how is he, or it of God? Can he be a power, or a power be in him of God any other wayes, then by his acquiring or receiving his power from God? yet this is that which they deny in the latter branch of their diſtinction, where they ſay, <hi>His acquiſition, or his way of having his power is not of God, but is of the Devill.</hi> Let the owners of this diſtinction bethink themſelves how they can diſtinguiſh betwixt the being of the power from God, and the acquiſition of the power from God, ſo as to affirm the one, and deny the other. In my dull conceit, the acquiſition of a thing is no more, nor no other thing but the way whereby that thing is had, or received; and if the queſtion be, how ſuch a thing is acquired, and it be ſaid it is of ſuch a perſon, or ſuch an author; this is to deſcribe the acquiſition of it. To me then, in thoſe two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions (whereby the diſtinction is applyed) the power is of God, the acquiſition of the power is not of God, but of the Devil, the ſubject of them is one and the ſame in ſenſe, and <hi>

                  <p>If they again make a refuge from this abſurdity of the generall inſtitution; and ſay in the former propoſition they mean the Uſurper is of God, his power is of God, in as much as God hath ordained Magiſtracy, and Magiſtrates to be; I anſwer; What is the Uſurper the neerer for this, that God hath ordained Magiſtrates to be? if he receive not his power from God, can it be ſaid nevertheleſſe his power is of God by vertue of that generall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution? We have foreſtalled this plea in our laſt Section, and ſay again, there is no conſequence, or dependency of the one of theſe upon the other. Gods ordaining Magiſtrates to be, inferres not this, or that man that is in the place of command (whether juſtly or unjuſtly) to be a Magiſtrate, of God. Nothing can be more weakly or groundleſly ſaid, then to argue this or that man is a power of Gods ordaining, becauſe God hath ordained that there ſhall be a power, and that ſome body or other ſhall be it. We have (I take it) proved before that to the making of a Magiſtrate to be of God, and to be his ordinance, <hi>in actu exercito,</hi> there goes, not only the law of God appointing Government to be in each community, but that a perſon, or perſons for his or their particular, be put into that office of God, that is in Gods way, or by his warrant; and this is to ſay, the perſons acquiſition of the power muſt be of God; It muſt be ſaid of them as <hi>Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nijah</hi> ſaid of <hi>Solomons</hi> Kingdom, <hi>it was his from the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The former puts not any Government, or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors in being, makes no man actually either a Prince, or a Subject; notwithſtanding it all the Common-wealths in the world may be headleſſe, or without Ruler. If a man ſhould ſtart up in the midſt of a Kingdome, or a City, or of a Senate, or Parliament, and proclaim himſelf to be the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme power over that community, and being asked upon what he grounds his claim, he ſhould alledge but this, God hath ordained a Supreme power to be in every State, and that ſome be Rulers, and now I
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:114672:122"/> actually challenge it; how ridiculous would this man and his claim be?</p>
                  <p>In the time when prophecy and prophets were ſent out of God into the world, and into his Church, there were true Prophets, and there were falſe: the difference betwixt them was, that the one were Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets indeed, <hi>were of God, ordained of God;</hi> the other indeed were no Prophets, were not of God. [<hi>Zech.</hi> 23.5. <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.16, 21, 26.] It would have been a ſenſeleſſe plea for the latter to have ſaid for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, We are Prophets of God, becauſe God hath ordained prophecy, and hath ſet in his Church ſome to be Prophets; And as reaſonleſſe an allegation it is to ſay, the Uſurper, or the Uſurpers power is of God, becauſe God hath inſtituted powers to be in the Common-wealth. Suppoſe a couple be ſuſpected to live together in whoredome, and being brought before the Magiſtrate under that accuſation, they ſhall pretend, for their defence, that they are in a marryed eſtate, and being required to prove their marriage, they ſhould alleadge that marriage is Gods ordinance, God hath ordained men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to marry, and they cohabite together as man and wife. Would this paſſe for truth, that theſe two are in the ſtate and relation they pretend to?</p>
                  <p>Much leſſe would it ſerve if the one of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties only ſhould make this pretence, and plea, and the other quite diſclaim it; and what's the reaſon this allegation would not paſſe, but becauſe there is required, beſides the generall rule ordaining mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to be, and the exerciſe of conjugall acts, that there be an entrance into this eſtate, and admittance unto theſe matrimoniall acts, by ſuch a covenant, or conſent of the parties, as God hath appointed to be the way, and means of contracting this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation?</p>
                  <p>But ſome of the Authors of this diſtinction thus argue. <hi>Riches gotten by uſury, extortion, &amp;c. ceaſe not to be good in themſelves, yea and the gifts of God: and as the owner of theſe unjuſtly procured riches may be
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:114672:122"/> ſaid to be a rich man, and he that hath Learning, though procured by unlawfull means, may be ſaid to be a Learned man; ſo the poſſeſſor of a moſt juſtly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained authority may be ſaid to be a Magiſtrate, and in authority.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Unto this Reaſoning I have this to ſay. 1. <hi>Riches gotten by uſury, and extortion, ceaſe not to be good in themſelves;</hi> Say they, It's true, but what is this to the uſurer, or extortioner, or to his poſſeſſion of them, or to his denomination of being rich by them? Let it be diſtinctly obſerv'd, what the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of thoſe riches is which ceaſeth not by their ill getting. That goodneſſe which is in them as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered abſolutely, and in themſelves, without reſpect to this, or that owner, or getter, and which was therefore attributable to them before they came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the uſurers or extortioners hands, they ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that is a goodneſſe <hi>in genere entis,</hi> or as Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and a goodneſſe <hi>in genere utilis,</hi> which is an aptneſſe to ſerve unto a naturally, or civilly profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table uſe; but thoſe Goods which taken apart from ſuch, or any other particular owners poſſeſſion have that goodneſſe inherent in them, are more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over ſuſceptible, by way of relative denomination, of another goodneſſe, which is not inherent in them, or in their nature, or neceſſary, and fixed to them, but is to them adventitious, or extrinſecall, and therefore is mutable, ſo that they are as well capable of an evilneſſe oppoſite to it, as of that good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                  <p>This goodneſſe and evilneſſe is morall, and it comes, or is imputable to them by means of their adjacency, or relation to their poſſeſſor. In this reſpect riches are ſaid to be ſometimes juſt, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times unjuſt, or to be honeſt, or diſhoneſt accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as they are gotten well, or ill, in this morall, or relative conſideration of riches (wherein alone the ſimilitude betwixt them and the matter in hand is pertinent) it is not true that riches gotten by uſury and ex ortion are good.<note place="margin">

Certainly it is not their meaning to make the uſurers, and extortioners way, and title to their riches (by ſo much as the gift of God comes to) better then the uſurpers way, and his Title to his power, whileſt they ſay their goods are the gifts of God, but his power is not acquired of God.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. Neither do riches denominate their unjuſt poſſeſſor rich. This follows upon the former. For ſeeing the haver of unjuſtly gotten goods is a bare poſſeſſor, or a meer holder, and uſer of goods, and not the true owner or proprietor of them, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not from ſuch riches, be truly termed a rich man. A poſſeſſor in fact, (or, in reſpect of that poſſeſſion, which the Civilian calls a naturall) deſerves not to be called rich, neither is he in many caſes vulgarly ſo eſteemed. A thief may by robbery have gotten into his hands a great treaſure; yea, a man may be a juſt occupant of a wealthy eſtate, he may be a depoſitary, a mutuary, or an uſufructuary thereof, that is, he may have it in his cuſtody, and uſe by way of truſt, hire, or tenantry, yet ſuch a one if he be wiſe, counts not himſelf a rich man in any ſuch reſpect, neither doth the world (underſtanding how he hath it) ſo repute him. A meer occupancy that is eftſoon voidable by law, or that is determinable by a little time, or that is accountable, for to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proprietor, is not wont to denominate the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupant rich. But to make both theſe points a little clearer, we are to diſtinguiſh of injuſtice, or evil dealing in the getting of wealth. There is ſome wrong in getting, which is ſo deep, and intrinſecall to the ſubſtance of the title, as that it doth vitiate and deſtroy its being, and the contract, or other way of procuring the goods by means thereof is null as to the producing of a property to the procurer. And there is ſome injuſtice that reacheth not ſo far as to evacuate the title. Every ſlip, or deviation from the path of uprightneſſe doth not make void a bargain, or title about which it is uſed. <hi>Caſuiſts</hi> diſtinguiſh therefore betwixt that <hi>dolus malus,</hi> that evil dealing, which gives cauſe to the contract, and that which is only incident or circumſtantiall to it, and ſay, the former doth nullifie a contract, but not

But wealth attained in the former way of injuſtice can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not entitle a man rich, becauſe the tranſaction ſo qualified, doth not truly cauſe, or make a property: he that hath them but ſo hath no title to them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed unto him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They ſay, <hi>He that hath learning, though procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by unlawfull means, may be ſaid to be a learned man.</hi> Here I ſay,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Learning is no morall habit, and therefore the denomination by it is not concerned by the manner, or means of its acquiſition: but a morall habit, as is the having of riches, and the having of civil power, muſt have a morall conſtitution. The difference betwixt theſe two in this matter will eaſily appear by comparing the naturall relation of father and ſon, with the morall relation of hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and wife. He is truly ſaid to be a father that begets a child, though it be in whoredome, and a baſtard is truly called a ſon. But two cannot be called husband and wife from naturall copulation, but there muſt be betwixt them, beſides that, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or contract for ſubſtance valid, and lawfull to ſet them in that relation. The reaſon of this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is, becauſe the former, that of father and ſon, is a naturall relation, in regard of its riſe, or the act by which it is founded: the other is a morall relation as to the way of its production, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt reſult from a morall act.</p>

                  <p>Having thus diſcovered the unſutableneſſe of the premiſes to inferre that concluſion, that the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor of a moſt unjuſtly obtained authority may be ſaid to be a Magiſtrate, and in authority; that concluſion as to ſupport by them, falls of it ſelf: But I may adde, as to the tearms of it, as I ſaid, and ſhewed before that the unjuſt poſſeſſor of riches cannot be called the owner of them; ſo may I here reply, thoſe words, <hi>[the poſſeſſor of a moſt unjuſtly obtain'd authority]</hi> are a contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>in adjecto.</hi> A moſt unjuſtly obtained authority there can properly be none: a man cannot be a poſſeſſor of authority, that is authority indeed, but by lawfull means. He that holdeth, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſeth command, rule, or ſway moſt unjuſtly, (as to title) may pretend to authority, but the command he aſſumes cannot (but abuſively and equivocally) be called authority. Authority (as hath been before made good) conſiſteth in a right, or call to rule, and is formally, and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially contradiſtinct to unjuſtly obtained autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. I ſpeak of that which is held, or ſtandeth meerly by unjuſt means: for, (as was before noted of injuſtice in the acquiſition of Goods) there may be a miſcarriage incident to, which is
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:114672:125"/> not of the ſubſtance of the Magiſtrates ingreſſe into, or tenure of authority. There is a faulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the very nature, or eſſence, and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; and a faultineſſe in ſome circumſtances of the acquiſition of authority. A man may come into, or hold the throne by a juſt title of perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal election, or hereditary ſucceſſion, and yet ſome indirect, or undue paſſage may be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven in the election, or the actuating of that ſucceſſion; which notwithſtanding, the election, or ſucceſſion, being for ſubſtance lawfull, there is a true Magiſtracy, or reall authority deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on that perſon.

                     </gap>ſt extent, to which the word, or thing ſpoken of doth ſometimes reach; but muſt be underſtood with ſome qualification.

                     </gap>eady given, here bring two more, which are for form and matter of ſpeciall affinity with this. The firſt is a univerſall negative of a parallel ſubject, or matter, an office of ſuperiority, or rule, wherein though the words run as theſe are ſuppoſed to do, in the generall without any limitation expreſſed, yet they muſt be taken in this manner. It is that of [<hi>Heb.</hi> 5 4] <hi>No man taketh this honour unto himſelf but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.</hi> This univerſall muſt not be conſtrued to be an abſolute, or illimited negation of the fact, as if no man at all doth, or ever did take unto himſelf the honour of the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood uncalled of God. For <hi>Korah</hi> with his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and <hi>Jeroboams</hi> Prieſts, and King <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah,</hi> and <hi>Amaziah</hi> the Prieſt of <hi>Bethel</hi> did it. But we muſt take it as intended to be ſaid with this reſtriction, no man man that legally, rightly, or warrantably proceedeth, takes this honour unto himſelf, but he that is, as <hi>Aaron</hi> was, called of God. So here, <hi>there is no power but of God;</hi> not as if there was never any <hi>Dathan,</hi> or an <hi>Abiram</hi> to invade the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates office, as well as there was a <hi>Korah</hi> to uſurp the Prieſts; or, as if though there were, yet the uſurping <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> were <hi>powers</hi> of God in the Apoſtles ſenſe here, though <hi>Korah,</hi> and ſuch like preſumers were not Prieſts of God: but, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king theſe two places to run very parallel, for like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe both of matter, and of univerſall negativeneſs, we may ſay, as that of the Prieſthood, ſo this of the Magiſtrate muſt be conſtrued to intend there is no power legally, warrantably, or regularly ſet up, but
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:114672:130"/> it is of God. The <hi>Divines Annotations</hi> upon that of <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.4. give us a good rule to underſtand many ſuch univerſalls by, to wit, <hi>Verbs active in the phraſe of the Scripture ſometimes import; not the act it ſelf, but duty, or office; no man taketh, that is, ought to take this honour upon himſelf, but he that is called of God.</hi> So here, though every particular power <hi>de facto</hi> be not of God, yet <hi>de jure</hi> there is none but that is. The power that is as it ought to be (as the high Prieſt that is in his office of right) is of God, ordained of God. The other Scripture inſtance is in the words that lie next to our Text, in the ſame Verſe with it, to wit, the antecedent precept, <hi>Let every ſoul be ſubject to the higher powers.</hi> This univerſall imperative muſt not be taken abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, or to ſtretch to all men without reſtriction, for if every ſoul without exception were to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject there could be none left to be the higher powers, and, beſides, there are, or may be ſome that are not of, or within any Common-wealth, and perhaps ſome Common-wealths may be for ſome time deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of rulers over them, [as <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.11.] but <hi>every ſoul</hi> muſt be limited within this circumſcription, every perſon that is a member of a body politick, and is in the relation and ſtate of a ſubject, every ſuch ſoul muſt be ſubject. So in theſe words, <hi>there is no power but of God,</hi> that is, there is none in the relation, or ſtate of a Magiſtrate, no morall, autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized or lawfull power, but it is of God, ſet up, and ordained to it by him.</p>

And this conſtruction, moreover, beſt ſuits with that which the whole ſtream of Interpreters (as far I can obſerve) judge to be the proper occaſion, and ſcope of the Apoſtles diſcourſe of this ſubject, of civil policy, in this place, to wit, that whereas the Chriſtians then, or ſome of them did, or might make queſtion of ſubjection to the higher powers, in reference to the Rulers, being unchriſtian, unjuſt, and tyrannicall as to exerciſe of Government, his drift is to charge the duty of obedience upon them with relation even to ſuch Magiſtrates: and to argue them unto a ſubmiſſion to it as applyed to ſuch, he reaſons chiefly from the Divine ordination, and warrant of the powers unto their office, and plainly averres, whatſoever they be for perſonall qualification, or manner of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet, if they be higher powers, indeed, they have their place, and calling from God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are to be obeyed.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle elſewhere beſpeaking Chriſtians for one particular duty to theſe higher powers, to wit, to pray, and give thanks for them, he extends this duty univerſally to all them that are in authority, [1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1.] yet, as <hi>Beza</hi> obſerves, this univerſall muſt be taken thus indiſcriminately, that is, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to all ſorts, and not diſtributively to all ſingle perſons in authority, to wit, that heathen as well as Chriſtian, miſgoverning as well as good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates are to be prayed for.

But from that indefinite ſpeech of <hi>Solomon,</hi> no man may gather it was in his intention, and drift to own, or father every act of every King, Prince, Noble, and Judge, upon either God or Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; the words muſt needs be underſtood only of ſuch acts of thoſe perſons as are juſt, righteous, and prudentiall. Certainly there are acts of rule (ſuch as are rehearſed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.2. the Kings, and Rulers of the earth ſet themſelves, and conſult a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, and Chriſt, and a thouſand more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull courſes of ſuch) which muſt of neceſſity be excluded from that generall ſaying. Now as from thoſe indefinite words we muſt not inferre that all acts of Magiſtrates are from God, ſo neither may we conclude from the like indefiniteneſſe of theſe words of the Apoſtle, that ſimply, and univerſally every power that is in being (any way whatſoever) is of God, by his ordination.</p>
                  <p>Whatever any one may judge of the congruity of any of theſe limitations unto the univerſall note ſuppoſed in this Text, yet I think no conſiderate Reader but will eaſily grant that ſome ſuch reſtricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt be admitted to the words. We have before diſtinguiſht of a fourfold lawfulneſſe, and unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe in powers. Now it muſt needs be yeelded that powers in ſome of thoſe four wayes unlawfull muſt be debarred the Text, and conſequently that the propoſitions in it muſt receive ſome limitation unto powers that are lawfull.</p>
                  <p>Among other falſe pretenders to power by vertue of the Text, the Pope comes in; and he offereth

To his claim upon this ground we have no anſwer if we grant him the words to hold in an abſolute univerſall form. But, to cut off this his forged pretence, we reply, the Text aſſerts not ſimply of every power, that it is of God, but of that power which is by other rules of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture juſtifiable, and lawfull. If then to rid our hands of this corrupt gloſſe we muſt be driven to confeſſe the indefinite, (or ſay it be univerſall) form of theſe words muſt needs admit of a confinement, to lawfull, warranted powers; it is enough to barre out the argument, from the illimitedneſſe of the propoſition. And further, then it will be ſaid this lawfull, muſt either exclude powers in any ſenſe unlawfull, or in ſome ſenſe only, if the latter, then ſome good reaſon muſt be given why one ſort of unlawfull power ſhould not be ſhut out of the Text by it as well as another; which I expect will never be aſſigned: If the former, then is power un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull as to title, or uſurped power chaſhiered the Text.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. I Thus argue. If a government by hereditary ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion be lawful, and in it the predeceſſor dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or otherwiſe ceaſing, the ſucceeding heire is immediately the power, or the ſupream Magiſtrate, without, or before actual poſſeſſion, acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or inveſture by the Eſtates, or people over whom he is the power; then it is not actual poſſeſſion which puts the power in being.

He is ſtill an oppreſſor in reference to that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the act committed againſt him though he be now dead. The reaſon is, though the wronged per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſo the property that was in him to thoſe poſſeſſions, (as all accidents inherent in him as a man) be extinct, yet the Law, or rule which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad, and condemned that act is ſtill alive, or in force: beſides, though the party injured, and ſo his

For, though he here avenge in his own cauſe, yet, neither doth he it of his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, or motion, neither doth he meerly, or formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vindicate himſelf, neither, if he rightly go about it, doth he therein ſo much conſider, or conſult him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as others.</p>
                  <p>Now let the clear ſenſe of this prohibition of ſelf-revenge, and the commandement, of giving place to wrath, with the inſtitution of the Magiſtrate to be a revenger to execute wrath, and the diſtinction betwixt theſe two revengings be conſidered, and the concluſion againſt the intruſive, unwarranted, meer poſſeſſory power will be thence very evident.</p>

                  <p>Object. 1. <hi>WHen the Apoſtle wrote this to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in</hi> Rome, <hi>the Roman Emperour that then was in the Throne, was an uſurper: yet the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, in willing them to ſubject to the higher powers in this Te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> There are two things, which make up the ſubſtance of this Argument, the which, could they be evidenced, would make this objection unanſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and carry the ſenſe of this Text quite contrary to the whole Diſcourſe I have hitherto made of it: But, if either of them be left inevident, or doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, the objection failes, and the ſenſe given ſtands notwithſtanding it.</p>
                  <p>The two things that muſt be certain to make the argument good are,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 That the Apoſtle in this exhortation unto <hi>ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the higher powers,</hi> and this affirmation of the <hi>power to be of God, ordained of God,</hi> intendeth, or hath his eye upon the Roman Emperour, as the ſupreame power of the Roman State.</p>

                  <p>As for the former: who ſo looks into the Roman Hiſtories of thoſe times will underſtand, that there was then (to wit, in the time of the Emperours <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus, Claudius,</hi> and <hi>Nero</hi>) a Roman Senate in being, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But taking the government that then was <hi>(in complexo)</hi> as juſt, and therefore neceſſary to be ſubjected to, he exhorts to that duty towards it, and that with this reaſon, becauſe, <hi>of God, ordained of God.</hi>

That this is their importance I will not ſeem to obtrude my aſſertion upon the Reader, now he hath the words before him.

                  <p>Without particularizing what things are of this nature, that it is ſo may eaſily appear, if we but make a compariſon by inverting the caſe, and putting the action on the Magiſtrates part. Let two perſons come before a lawfull Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, each with his cauſe, or ſuit, the one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a deniſon of the Countrey, the other being a foreiner; or, ſuppoſe them both alike for that, but the one having a juſt cauſe, or ſuit, the others being bad. The Magiſtrate in hearing, and handling theſe diverſe cauſes, or the cauſe of theſe diverſly qualified perſons, may, and is to doe in ſome kinde the ſame things for them all, and to treat them all alike: but in ſome kindes again he is to obſerve a difference, and his proceſſe may not be altogether the ſame to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſeveralls of them reſpectively, his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will require him in ſundry things to put a difference betwixt the deniſon and the foreiner; betwixt him that hath a juſt cauſe, and him that hath a bad. And thus is it on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects part, and in his actings: there is in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things a diverſity to be found in the rule of his proceedings in relation to thoſe two ſorts of ſuperiors, the juſt, and the unjuſt; or the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſed power, and the intruder.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In relation to the caſe wherein ſubjection is performable, the extent of it may be to be diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in reference to thoſe two. A lawfull, authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed Magiſtrate, one is required to ſubject himſelfe unto voluntarily, frankly, and out of the caſe of terror, or externall compulſorineſſe, and though he had ability to conteſt, ſtand our, and make good a refuſall; but not ſo to the meer poſſeſſor. It is then only neceſſary to comply, and ſometimes doth a thing then only come to be lawfull in reference to him, when matter of awe or menace is caſt into one of the ſcales of the ſubjects conſultation<note n="*" place="margin">See Dr. <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derion,</hi> and <hi>Grotius</hi> as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove cited.</note>.</p>

                  <p>HAving thus diſpatched anſwer to theſe objections, and queries, I intend to proceed no further: but think it time now to cloſe up this Chapter, and with it this Treatiſe.</p>
                  <p>There is but one query more that occurred to my obſervation as for anſwer here, <hi>viz. Seeing we have found the only ordinary mean of conveyance of Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination to the perſon who is by that ordination the power of God, to be the conſent of the Community</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>This queſtion ariſeth from the diverſity of wayes whereof the giving of conſent ſeemeth to be capable of: as,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Touching the perſons giving, conſent may be either of the whole; or of a part; and that whole may, either contain all, and ſingular the perſons united in one minde, or be the major part, admitted in virtue to be the whole.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Touching the manner wherein conſent is ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified; Civilians do deliver ſeverall wayes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent giving, as by word, by action, and by non-acting; and under theſe are reduced ſundry particulars.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As to the time, the conſent may either fore-run, or follow actuall inveſture.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. As to truth, and reality, the conſent may be either re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="5">5. As to the freedome, and conſequently as to the valid ty, it is ſuſceptible of differences more then one:</p>

                     <pb n="371" facs="tcp:114672:210"/>1. There is a naturall, or phyſicall freedom; and oppoſite to it a naturall reſtraint, or confinement. The naturall freedome is a remotion or clearneſs of outward coaction; and this reſpecteth,</p>

                  <p n="2">2. Or the minde, and this relateth to fear, from the menace, or danger of harm, or loſſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is a morall freedome, or a freedome of conſcience (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ruly ſo called). And oppoſite to it there is a morall reſtraint, to wit, by a preobligation, tye, or duty of conſcience.</p>
                  <p>The requiſiteneſſe of freedom, as the very formal reaſon, or conſtitutive eſſence of conſent, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſiteneſſe of both thoſe freedomes, that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, both the naturall, and the morall; a freedom both f om out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward force, and terror, and from preobligation of conſcience, are much inſiſted on.</p>
                  <p>There is not much materiall difficulty in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive determination of any of theſe differences except it be the laſt, the point of freedome: and for it I had rather ſuppoſe my intelligent Reader apprehenſive of what is right therein, then intangle him or my ſelf here in the diſpute of it.</p>
                  <p>The truth is, we commonly ſay <hi>Leave is light,</hi> and this proverb may be underſtood to hold, not onely of the eaſineſſe either of the obtaining or of the carriage of it ordinarily; but of the diſcernableneſs, clearneſs, and apparency, which for the moſt part is in that leave, or conſent which is unfeigned, and reall. But if there be any whoſe intereſt, or will inclines them to pretend to a conſent which is not, or to a freeneſs of conſent where it is not, I ſhall not for their uſe enter into a debate of it; doubting them to be of the number of thoſe who are condemned of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and for that I cannot aſſume either that free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to deal, or that hope to prevail with them, which I ſhould promiſe my ſelf in the undertaking.</p>
